	Abstract = {We examined relationships between tree ring-width and climate at 232 sites around the
circumpolar boreal forest to explore variability in two types of response to temperature: a
browning response characterized by inverse correlations between growth and temperature,
and a greening response characterized by positive correlations between growth and
temperature. We used moving-window correlation analysis for eight 30-year time
windows, lagged by 10 years, to characterize the climate response at each site
from 1902 to 2002. Inverse growth responses to temperature were widespread,
occurring in all species, all time periods, and in nearly all geographic areas. The
frequency of the browning response increased after 1942, while the frequency of the
greening response declined. Browning was concentrated in five species (Picea abies,
Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Picea obovata and Pinus banksiana), and occurred
more frequently in the warmer parts of species' ranges, suggesting that direct
temperature stress might be a factor. In some species, dry sites were also more likely to
experience browning; moisture stress might thus be an additional explanation in
some cases. As inverse responses to temperature are widespread, and occur in a
broad array of species, there is unlikely to be any single explanation for their
occurrence.},

	Abstract = {Climate change can have profound impacts on biodiversity and the sustainability of many ecosystems. Various studies have investigated the impacts of climate change, but large-scale, trait-specific impacts are less understood. We analyze abundance data over time for 86 tree species/groups across the eastern United States spanning the last three decades. We show that more tree species have experienced a westward shift (73\%) than a poleward shift (62\%) in their abundance, a trend that is stronger for saplings than adult trees. The observed shifts are primarily due to the changes of subpopulation abundances in the leading edges and are significantly associated with changes in moisture availability and successional processes. These spatial shifts are associated with species that have similar traits (drought tolerance, wood density, and seed weight) and evolutionary histories (most angiosperms shifted westward and most gymnosperms shifted poleward). Our results indicate that changes in moisture availability have stronger near-term impacts on vegetation dynamics than changes in temperature. The divergent responses to climate change by trait- and phylogenetic-specific groups could lead to changes in composition of forest ecosystems, putting the resilience and sustainability of various forest ecosystems in question.},

	Abstract = {Mixed-species forests and plantations sometimes have greater levels of ecosystem functions and services, including productivity, than monocultures. However, this is not always the case and there are many examples where mixtures are not more productive. Whether or not mixtures are more productive depends on the net effects of different types of interactions, and these are dynamic, changing through space and time. Many studies have examined how species interactions influence the growth of mixtures, but few have examined how spatial and temporal differences in resource availability or climatic conditions can influence these interactions. This review examines these spatial and temporal dynamics. The processes driving the dynamics are discussed using the production ecology equation, where plant growth is a function of resource availability, multiplied by the fraction of resources that are captured by the trees, multiplied by the efficiency with which the resources are used. Relative complementary effects depended on the types of species interactions and how resource availability changed. Complementary effects increased as soil nitrogen or water availability decreased when mixtures contained nitrogen fixing species, or when interactions were assumed to reduce competition for water. In contrast, some studies found that complementary effects increased with increasing site qualities, however in those studies there were no measurements of soil resource availability or any complementarity mechanisms. In those studies it was assumed that as growing conditions improved, competition for light increased and complementary effects resulted from interactions that improved light absorption or light-use efficiency. Multiple types of interactions can occur simultaneously in mixtures (e.g. nitrogen fixation, increased light absorption, and increased water-use efficiency) and so different resource availability-complementarity patterns will probably occur for a given pair of species, depending on the resource being examined. Less than half of the studies actually measured variables of the production ecology equation to indicate the processes driving the patterns. Several questions are listed that cannot yet be answered with confidence. Finally, stand structural characteristics, such as density, have also been shown to strongly increase or decrease complementarity effects and these need to be taken into account when interpreting results, but the mechanisms driving these density patterns were rarely quantified.},

@article{Forrester2017,
	Abstract = {Summary Promoting mixed-species forests is an important strategy for adaptation and risk reduction in the face of global change. Concurrently, a main challenge in ecology is to quantify the effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning. In forests, the effects of individual tree species on ecosystem functions depend largely on their dimensions, which are commonly predicted using allometric equations. However, little is known about how diversity influences allometry or how to incorporate this effect into allometric equations. Ignoring the effects of interspecific interactions on allometric relationships may result in severely biased predictions. This study examined the effects of tree-species diversity, competition and tree social status on crown-projection area (cpa), height (h) and live-crown length (lcl) of trees using a European-wide data set containing 17 target species and 12 939 trees. The cpa, h and lcl were predicted as functions of stem diameter at 1·3 m, tree-species diversity, tree height relative to the stand mean height (rh) and a competition index (CI) that accounted for stand density and interspecific differences in competitive ability based on species-specific wood density or shade tolerance. Averaged across species, diameter had the greatest effect on cpa and lcl, followed by the competition index, while rh had the greatest effect on lcl. Tree-species diversity had the smallest effect on cpa, h and lcl. Interspecific variability in cpa, h or lcl responses to diversity, CI, or rh was sometimes related to wood density or shade tolerance. Synthesis. This study shows the strong influence of stand structure and species composition on allometric relationships. These influences can be quantified using measures of competition, tree-species diversity and relative tree height so that general equations can be developed for a given species to be applied to a wide range of species compositions and stand structures. This new approach will greatly improve predictions of biomass and carbon stocks in structurally and compositionally diverse forests.},

	Abstract = {To explore within-gap spatial patterns of soil surface CO2 flux, we measured instantaneous soil surface CO2 flux, soil surface temperature, and soil moisture in north--south transects across canopy gaps and in adjacent contiguous forest from April to November 2010 in a second-growth northern hardwood forest in Wisconsin, USA. Throughout the growing season, soil surface CO2 flux was higher in the northern 1/3 and northern edge of gaps compared to the central and southern portions. These patterns were driven primarily by within-gap variation in soil temperature, which was itself driven by within-gap patterns of insolation. Most locations in the northern 1/3 and northern edge of gaps had significantly higher modeled total growing season C flux (mean 725 g C m−2) compared to the contiguous forest (mean 706 g C m−2), whereas C flux in the central and southern portions of gaps (mean 555 g C m−2) was significantly lower than both the contiguous forest and the northern portions of gaps.},

	Abstract = {In this study I have attempted to integrate two major topics: (1) the role of disturbance regimes in structuring communities, and (2) the effects of various disturbances on ecosystem---level processes such as nitrogen cycling. In an old---growth, northern hard---wood---hemlock forest in upper Michigan, USA, I measured net N (nitrogen) mineralization rates in small (90---250 m2), recent (0---3 yr) treefall gaps. These gaps were paired with plots in adjacent, undisturbed forest; half of the plots were dominated by eastern hemlock and half by sugar maple. Net N mineralization was measured using monthly on---site soil incubations. I made corresponding measures of other soil characteristics, moisture, and canopy opening (square metres) in each plot. The nitrogen mineralization rate varied with physical differences that existed between forest plots and gap plots, as well as with canopy species dominance. In gaps, N mineralization was higher under hemlock (forest, X = 95.3; gap, X = 107.3 kg$\,^{\circ}$ha---1$\,^{\circ}$yr---1) and lower under maple (forest, X = 102.0; gap, X = 88.5 kg$\,^{\circ}$ha---1$\,^{\circ}$yr---1). Nitrification of N was more than double in gaps under hemlock (forest, X = 27.4; gap, X = 69.8 kg/ha). Nitrification and soil pH were positively correlated in forest plots. I discuss the implications of these results for community compositional change and relevance to current hypotheses. These include hypotheses of mineralization rate change with disturbance, the role of nitrification in climax communities, and the influence of conifer canopy and litter on forest floor processes. Observed differences in these factors at this small---scale, single treefall level are compared with other large---scale whole---ecosystem studies. Implications for species adapted to this disturbance pattern are suggested. I hypothesize an interrelationship for the various observed changes in gaps and a mechanism for the exploitation of these increased resources by plants},

	Abstract = {As silvicultural objectives have changed over the last several decades, managers are increasingly designing cutting regimes that mimic natural disturbance with the hopes that such systems will restore forests to a more natural condition while optimizing harvest yield. Treefall gaps, canopy openings caused by the death of one or more trees, are the dominant form of disturbance in many forest systems worldwide. These gaps play an important role in forest ecology by helping to maintain bio- and pedo-diversity, influencing nutrient cycling, and preserving the uneven-age nature of late-successional forests. In gap literature, there are inconsistencies with regard to gap terminology, methods for identifying and studying gaps, and modeling gap disturbances. From the papers reviewed, the size of treefall gaps ranges widely from 10 to >5000m2; we suggest that the maximum gap size should be set at 1000m2. Larger openings tend to have microclimates and return intervals significantly different than smaller treefall gaps. Two main definitions of treefall gaps exist: canopy gap: a `hole' in the forest through all levels down to an average height of 2m above ground and extended gap: canopy gap plus the area that extends to the bases of surrounding canopy trees. Although researchers have assumed a variety of gap shapes to simplify measuring gap size, gaps are often irregularly shaped and so we recommend that gap areas and shapes be determined from detailed field measurements. Gap age may be determined from tree ring analysis of released trees in or near the gap edge, the spacing of whorls on released saplings, or from decomposition of gap-making trees. Windthrow is the main cause of canopy gaps in a variety of ecosystems; other causes include insects, diseases, acidic deposition, drought, and climate change. Treefall-gap models have been developed to predict the following processes during gap making or infilling: (i) gap abundance, (ii) forest structure, (iii) spatial and temporal variations in light levels, (iv) canopy dynamics, and (v) soil nutrient and water regimes. We recommend a protocol for gap studies and identify future research topics.},

@article{Lewandowski2016,
	Abstract = {Intensive forest biomass harvesting, or the removal of harvesting slash (woody debris from tree branches and tops) for use as biofuel, has the potential to negatively affect the soil microbial community (SMC) due to loss of carbon and nutrient inputs from the slash, alteration of the soil microclimate, and increased nutrient leaching. These effects could result in lowered forest productivity and threaten the long-term sustainability of forest management. Retaining organic material post-harvest, including greater amounts of harvesting slash and live trees, within harvested areas may ameliorate some negative effects of biomass harvesting on soil processes. We evaluated the effects of biomass harvests with reserve tree and slash retention on the SMC and soil nutrient bioavailability (assessed using plant-root simulator probes) in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests in northern Minnesota during the spring and summer, 1--3 years after harvest. Variable biomass removal levels tested include complete removal (whole tree harvest of boles and branches), complete slash retention (bole only harvest), and 20{\%} slash retention (amount suggested by regional biomass harvesting guidelines). Compared to the unharvested control, biomass harvests had no effect on the multivariate SMC composition or microbial biomass, but did result in a 1--4{\%} increase in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and reduced bacterial stress two and three years after harvest. Additionally, biomass harvesting increased NH4 bioavailability during year one, and reduced NO3 bioavailability during year two when compared to unharvested controls. Among the three biomass harvests with differing levels of slash removal there were few differences in overall SMC composition, microbial biomass, and soil nutrients; however, the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, gram positive and actinomycete bacteria were significantly higher in harvested treatments with more slash retained. These results are specific to single rotation biomass harvesting in aspen stands due to the unique relationships between plants and their associated SMCs, and may not be directly applicable to forest biomass harvesting of other commercial forest tree species, or multiple rotations.},

To better understand understory responses to canopy disturbance, we measured changes in the growth and physiology of the dominant understory shrub, American witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana L.), in response to girdling of canopy oaks in a temperate hardwood forest of the northeastern United States. Changes in the growth and physiology of H. virginiana may be important to the regeneration of northeastern temperate forests, as this common shrub largely shapes the microenvironment for seedlings on the forest floor where it occurs. Canopy disturbance by girdling resulted in significant increases in light and soil nitrogen availability. In response to these environmental changes, basal-area growth of H. virginiana increased by an average 334\%. This growth increase corresponded to significant increases in foliar nitrogen, respiration, and leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations. These findings indicate improved environmental conditions and increased growth for this understory shrub following the loss of dominant canopy trees. This study suggests that following large-scale canopy disturbance, H. virginiana and shrubs like it may play an important role in competing for soil N and shading seedlings of regenerating canopy species. },

	Abstract = {Forest harvesting and the associated loss of nutrients and carbon has the potential to negatively affect the soil microbial community, which plays a significant role in the health and productivity of the forest ecosystem. We used an experiment to evaluate the effects of group selection using whole-tree harvesting on the soil microbial community in a second growth northern hardwood forest dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in northern Wisconsin, USA. We compared the response of the soil microbial community in 200m2 and 380m2 harvested gaps to unharvested controls during the spring and summer in the first two years post-harvest, and continued to monitor changes in the soil microbial communities and microenvironment in 380m2 gaps in years four, five, and seven post-harvest. Changes in community size and composition were assessed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. We found that the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi initially decreased following harvest, while abundance of anaerobic and gram positive bacteria, and the cyclo/pre-cyclo microbial stress ratio increased; responses that can be linked to microclimatic variability and resource accessibility. Neither actinomycete bacteria nor saprotrophic fungi exhibited an initial response to harvest, but in later years, we observed a decrease in actinomycetes and an increase in fungal abundance, suggesting a competitive interaction between the two main complex carbon-utilizing microbial groups. Canopy gap size had a minimal effect on the soil microbial community, resulting in a higher microbial stress ratio in 200m2 gaps. The microbial community exhibited seasonal and yearly fluctuation, which reinforces the need for repeated sampling over multiple seasons to correctly interpret management effects. Despite the large amount of seasonal and yearly variability, we began to see signs of recovery in the soil microbial community between two and four years post-harvest. We conclude that group selection accomplished via whole-tree harvesting of this size and scale does not result in long-term effects on the soil microbial community in this temperate northern hardwood forest.},

	Abstract = {Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed {\$}1 billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.},

	Abstract = {{In recent decades, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in inner-Alpine dry valleys of Switzerland have suffered from drought and elevated temperatures, resulting in a higher mortality rate of trees than the mean mortality rate in Switzerland. We investigated the responses of fine roots (standing crop, morphological and physiological features) to water supply in a Scots pine forest in the Rhone valley. Before irrigation started in 2003, low- and high-productivity Scots pine trees were selected based on their crown transparency. The fine root standing crop measured in spring from 2003 to 2005 was unaffected by the irrigation treatment. However, irrigation significantly enhanced the fine root standing crop during the vegetation period when values from spring were compared with values from fall in 2005. Irrigation slightly increased specific root length but decreased root tissue density. Fine root O2-consumption capacity decreased slightly in response to the irrigation treatment. Using ingrowth cores to observe the responses of newly produced fine roots, irrigation had a significantly positive effect on the length of fine roots, but there were no differences between the low- and high-productivity trees. In contrast to the weak response of fine roots to irrigation, the aboveground parts responded positively to irrigation with more dense crowns. The lack of a marked response of the fine root biomass to irrigation in the low- and high-productivity trees suggests that fine roots have a high priority for within-tree carbon allocation.}},

While the impacts of single droughts on forests have been widely studied4--6, understanding whether forests acclimate to or become more vulnerable to sequential droughts remains largely unknown and is crucial for predicting future forest health. We combine cross-biome datasets of tree growth, tree mortality and ecosystem water content to quantify the effects of multiple droughts at a range of scales from individual trees to the globe from 1900 to 2018. We find that subsequent droughts generally have a more deleterious impact than initial droughts, but this effect differs enormously by clade and ecosystem, with gymnosperms and conifer-dominated ecosystems more often exhibiting increased vulnerability to multiple droughts. The differential impacts of multiple droughts across clades and biomes indicate that drought frequency changes may have fundamentally different ecological and carbon-cycle consequences across ecosystems.},

Recent studies have documented increasing spatial synchrony between populations at continental scales and linked it to anthropogenic climate change. However, the lack of long-term and global baseline perspectives on spatial synchrony presents a challenge to understanding the importance of these trends. Here, we show a steady rise in the spatial synchrony of annual tree growth from a global tree ring database over the past 50 years that is consistent across continents, species and environmental conditions and is unprecedented for the past millennium. Increasing growth synchrony coincided with warming trends and potentially rising synchrony in the temperature records. We discuss the potential driving mechanisms and the limitations in the interpretation of this trend, and we propose that increasing mutual dependency on external factors (also known as Moran's effect) linked to rising global temperatures is the most likely driver of more homogeneous global growth dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We used LANDIS, a model of forest disturbance and succession, to simulate successional dynamics of forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The simulated environments are based on the Great Smoky Mountains landscapes studied by Whittaker. We focused on the consequences of two contrasting disturbance regimes---fire exclusion versus frequent burning---for the Yellow pine (Pinus L., subgenus Diploxylon Koehne) and oak (Quercus L.) forests that occupy dry mountain slopes and ridgetops. These ecosystems are a conservation priority, and declines in their abundance have stimulated considerable interest in the use of fire for ecosystem restoration. Under fire exclusion, the abundance of Yellow pines is projected to decrease, even on the driest sites (ridgetops, south- and west-facing slopes). Hardwoods and White pine (P. strobus L.) replace the Yellow pines. In contrast, frequent burning promotes high levels of Table Mountain pine (P. pungens Lamb.) and Pitch pine (P. rigida Mill.) on the driest sites and reduces the abundance of less fire-tolerant species. Our simulations also imply that fire maintains open woodland conditions, rather than closed-canopy forest. For oaks, fire exclusion is beneficial on the driest sites because it permits oaks to replace the pines. On moister sites (north- and east-facing slopes), however, fire exclusion leads to a diverse mix of oaks and other species, whereas frequent burning favors Chestnut oak (Q. montana Willd.) and White oak (Q. alba L.) dominance. Our results suggest that reintroducing fire may help restore decadent pine and oak stands in the southern Appalachian Mountains.},

	Abstract = {Oak (Quercus spp.) is declining globally due to a variety of pests, pathogens and climate change. Assessments of the impact of losing keystone species such as oak, should include the impact on associated biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and consider mitigation options. Here, we assess the potential ecological implications of a decline in Quercus petraea/robur within the UK. We collated a database of 2300 species associated with Q. petraea/robur of which 326 were found to be obligate associates (only found on Q. petraea/robur). One potential mitigating measure for lessening the impact of oak decline on associated biodiversity would be establishing alternative tree species. However, of 30 alternative tree species assessed, none supported a high proportion of the oak-associated species (maximum 28{\%} by Fraxinus excelsior ash, which is currently declining due to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, a fungus). However, the functioning of oak (leaf litter/soil chemistry and decomposition) was potentially replicable owing to its similarities with other tree species. The impact on the four main oak woodland communities within the UK, of a theoretical 50{\%} decline in oak on ecosystem functioning and associated species was explored for five scenarios, that differed in the selection of replacement tree species. The most resilient woodland communities (in all the aspects assessed) were those capable of supporting the greatest diversity of tree species and when the currently occurring tree species replaced oak. The greatest change was predicted where F. excelsior was lost in addition to a decline in oak, and if only one species, particularly Acer pseudoplantanus sycamore, filled the canopy gaps.},

Despite a regional research-based understanding of prehistoric and historic fire regimes, a parallel understanding of contemporary fire use to preserve oak forests is only emerging, and with somewhat inconsistent results. For prescribed fires to be effective, they must positively influence oak regeneration at one or more critical life stages: pollination, flowering, seed set, germination, establishment, seedling development, and release into the canopy. We posit that a simplistic view of the relationship between fire and oak forests has led to a departure from an ecologically based management approach with prescribed fire. Here, we call for a refinement in our thinking to improve the match between management tools and objectives and provide some guidelines for thinking more ecologically about when and where to apply fire on the landscape to sustain oak-dominated forests.}},

Forests in which dynamics are controlled by one or a few foundation species appear to be dominated by a small number of strong interactions and may be highly susceptible to alternating between stable states following even small perturbations. The ongoing decline of many foundation species provides a set of important, albeit unfortunate, opportunities to develop the research tools, models, and metrics needed to identify foundation species, anticipate the cascade of immediate, short- and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function that will follow from their loss, and provide options for remedial conservation and management.},

	Abstract = {Artificial gaps are widely created for forest management. However, the interactive effects of gap sizes and within-gap locations on seedling regeneration are rarely tested. Therefore, whether there are lower and upper size limits for artificial gaps remains controversial. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the effects of within-gap positions on seedling regeneration are dependent on gap sizes. Newly germinated wild seedlings of shade-intolerant Quercus mongolica scattered in different positions within artificially created gaps of different sizes were surveyed to test our hypothesis. Large gaps promoted seedling growth more than medium and small gaps. The increase in Q. mongolica seedling growth in large gaps can be largely attributed to the dormancy breaking of the apical buds and increased net photosynthetic rates. More importantly, we showed that the effects of within-gap position were prominent only in medium gaps, i.e., the effect of within-gap position appears to be dependent on gap size. We show an integrative effect of gap size and within-gap location on seedling performance of shade-intolerant oaks, suggesting future studies should evaluate the influence of within-gap location in conjunction with the role of gap size. We therefore suggest that gap creation in silvicultural systems should highlight the lower and upper size limits of forest gaps, which will vary with the species and regions studied.},

	Abstract = {Although oaks (Quercus spp.) have historically dominated much of the forest land in eastern North America, a great deal of fragmentary and sometimes anecdotal evidence suggests that they have been yielding dominance in recent decades to other, typically more shade-tolerant species. Using FIA data, our work formally quantifies the change in oak abundance in the eastern U.S. during the period of 1980--2008. The results indicate that most areas in the eastern U.S. experienced some decline in oak abundance, but the decrease was not universal either geographically or among species. Declines were especially marked in the Central Hardwood Region, which lost oak abundance on 81% its forested area as measured by importance value (IV). Areas with a high oak abundance were more likely to see a reduction in abundance. Among all 25 species analyzed, eight species decreased significantly in IV while two increased. Both the top two most prevalent white oak species (white oak (Quercus alba) and post oak (Quercus stellata)) and red oak species (northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and black oak (Quercus velutina)) had significant decreases in density and IV. Water oak (Quercus nigra) is one of the red oak species that had a near universal increase of its abundance throughout its native range (83% of area). This study provided a comprehensive quantification of the dynamic of oak species in a regional-wide geographic context, which will provoke forest researchers and managers to revisit the oak decline problem by using knowledge from other regions and other species.},

@article{Izbicki2020,
	Abstract = {Across the central and eastern U.S., decades of fire exclusion have coincided with upland oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration problems and a compositional shift toward shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive species like red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). Because oaks are fire-adapted and moderately shade-intolerant, prescribed fire is commonly used as a management tool to decrease competition, increase light, and promote oak regeneration. However, prescribed fire alone often fails to sufficiently open the canopy and improve oak competitive status, suggesting the combination of fire and canopy gaps may be necessary for oak success. To better understand the effects of single and multiple prescribed fires alone and combined with naturally-formed canopy gaps on tree regeneration, we measured tree densities (both seed and resprout origin) in five height size classes (small seedlings: ≤0.5 m, large seedlings (>0.5--1.0 m), saplings (1.1--4.0 m), midstory (4.1--7.0 m), and poles (7.1--12 m)) within gaps and non-gap areas treated with no fire, single fire, or multiple fires (2--3) across six sites within the Knobs Region of Kentucky (U.S.A.) in 2017. Oaks were common as small and large seedlings without fire, especially within gaps, but they were largely absent from larger size classes. Instead, red maples and American beech dominated sapling and midstory size classes without fire, regardless of gap treatment. Single and multiple fires reduced both absolute and relative density of American beech saplings and red oaks (Q. velutina Lam., Q. coccinea Munchh. and Q. rubra L.) of all sizes, but single fires, both within and outside of gaps, increased red maple large seedling, sapling, and midstory dominance. Multiple fires, both within and outside of gaps, reduced red maple abundance, and this coincided with increased relative density of white (Q. alba L.) and chestnut oaks (Q. montana Willd.), but not of red oaks. Red oak small and large seedlings were the only oaks where absolute density increased in the small (~300 m2), relatively old (20--30 yr), naturally-formed canopy gaps in this study. Our findings suggest that management techniques that include multiple prescribed fires and large canopy gaps (>300 m2) created relatively soon after fire will likely be necessary to reduce competing species, increase oak density, and allow oaks to reach sapling and midstory size classes.},

Canopy openings covered 9.5\% of total land area. New gaps were formed at an average of 1\% of total land area per year; old gap area closed at a similar rate primarily by sapling height growth. With increasing gap size, vegetation within gaps increased in woody species diversity, total basal area, and total number of stems. Stems also showed accelerated growth into larger size classes. As gaps aged, stems grew into larger size classes and basal area increased. Species responses to canopy gaps varied. Some species survived and became established in fairly small gaps (50---100 m2). Although in large gaps (up to 2009 m2 in the present study) these species usually increased in total number of stems and basal area, they declined in importance relative to species which rarely survived in small gaps but grew rapidly in large gaps. The disturbance regimes in the forests studied favored tolerant species but allowed opportunists to persist at low densities.},

	Abstract = {Using a radial growth averaging technique, decadal-scale changes in growth rates of overstory oaks were used to identify canopy accession events at five old-growth sites. A review of tree-ring chronologies yielded three growth strategies: (1) one-half of the oaks originated in a large opening and achieved overstory status before canopy closure; (2) 38% originated in a smaller opening and required a second gap event to attain overstory status; and (3) 13% achieved overstory status after an extended period of very low growth in understory shade and one or two subsequent gap releases. For trees that required a major canopy release, understory residence times averaged 89, 54, 50 and 38 years for white oak, northern red oak, black oak, and chestnut oak, respectively. Average diameters (inside bark) at canopy accession were 13.3, 11.7, 10.0, and 6.2cm for the four oak species, respectively. Although there is some historical precedence for these values, few contemporary second-growth forests contain understory oaks of this age, particularly red oak. These long understory residence times suggest that the level of understory shade, and by inference, the abundance of shade tolerant understory species, was considerably less before 1900.},

Stem maps and tree-establishment and canopy-accession chronologies were then used to reconstruct the size of canopy openings. Between 1700 and 1990, median canopy disturbance interval was approximately 3 yr for each stand; larger disturbances involving two or more trees occurred about every 16 yr per stand. Based on age distribution of the oldest cohorts, three stands became established after a major disturbance, but the majority of multiple-tree disturbances were associated with gaps \\&lt; 200 m2 in area. Historic disturbance frequency and size distribution of canopy gaps suggest that the oak components of these stands persisted by utilizing a variety of growth strategies appropriate to large and small openings. The absence of significant changes in overstory disturbance frequencies further suggests that increases in the level of understory competition are responsible for the present-day decline in oak dominance.}},

There is also evidence from observational and modeling studies for an elevation-dependent climate response within some mountain regions. Our understanding of climate change in mountains, however, remains challenging owing to inadequacies in observations and models. In fact, it is still uncertain whether mountainous regions generally are warming at a different rate than the rest of the global land surface, or whether elevation-based sensitivities in warming rates are prevalent within mountains. We review studies of four high mountain regions -- the Swiss Alps, the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Tibetan Plateau/Himalayas, and the Tropical Andes -- to examine questions related to the sensitivity of climate change to surface elevation. We explore processes that could lead to enhanced warming within mountain regions and possible mechanisms that can produce altitudinal gradients in warming rates on different time scales. A conclusive understanding of these responses will continue to elude us in the absence of a more comprehensive network of climate monitoring in mountains.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}(1) Data from a vascular plant survey of the southern Appalachian high peaks, U.S.A., were used to model the relationship between five floristic categories of species richness (total, high elevation, northern, endemic and rare species), six topographic variables (area above 1680 m, area above 1830 m, maximum elevation, number of peaks, inter-mountain distance and latitude) and the number of community types. (2) The best model of species richness varied with each richness category: total richness was best modelled by number of communities, high elevation species by area, northern species by area, endemic species by number of communities and rare species by maximum elevation. (3) In simple regressions, there was no clear preference among model formulations or species richness transformations. Elevation, number of peaks and area were all relatively important predictors, while isolation was unimportant. In multiple regression models, linear formulations were almost always the strongest. For total species richness, the best multiple regression model was linear and the most important predictor was the number of peaks. (4) Rare species richness increased faster with area or elevation than any other richness category (slope coefficients for log (rare species)--log (area) models were 0.30 for the whole data set and 0.49 for the eight largest areas). (5) Distance between mountains almost always had a positive, though usually minor, effect on species richness, thus casting doubt on the appropriateness of the MacArthur and Wilson model for this data set. We hypothesize that distance between mountain areas is probably a poor measure of ecological isolation and that historic extinctions have shaped the species-area relations we observed.{$]$}},

@article{Ibanez2007,
	Abstract = {Predicting vegetation shifts under climate change is a challenging endeavor, given the complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables that influence demographic rates. To determine how current trends and variation in climate change affect seedling establishment, we analyzed demographic responses to spatiotemporal variation to temperature and soil moisture in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We monitored seedling establishment for 10 years in five plots located along an elevational gradient of five dominant tree species: Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, and Quercus rubra. A hierarchical Bayes model allowed us to incorporate different sources of information, observation errors, and the inherent variability of the establishment process. From our analysis, spring temperatures and heterogeneity in soil moisture emerge as key drivers, and they act through nonlinear population demographic processes. We found that all species benefited from warmer springs, in particular the species found on dry slopes, N. sylvatica, and those dominant at higher elevations, Betula spp. and Q. rubra. This last species also benefited from dry environments. Conversely, L. tulipifera, which is abundant on mesic sites, experienced highest establishment rates at high moisture. The mechanisms behind these results may differ among species. Higher temperatures are apparently more important for some, while dry conditions and reduced pathogenic attacks on their seeds and new seedlings have a large impact for others. Our results suggest that only communities found at higher elevations are in danger of regional extinction when their habitats disappear given the current climatic trends. We conclude that the recruitment dynamics of the communities where these species are dominant could be affected by minor changes in climate in ways that cannot be predicted using only climate envelopes, which use different variables and miss the nonlinearities.},

@article{Speer2009,
	Abstract = { The climatic response of trees that occupy closed canopy forests in the eastern United States (US) is important to understanding the possible trajectory these forests may take in response to a warming climate. Our study examined tree rings of 664 trees from five oak species (white (Quercus alba L.), black (Quercus velutina Lam.), chestnut (Quercus prinus L.), northern red (Quercus rubra L.), scarlet (Quercus coccinea M{\"u}nchh.)) from 17 stands in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, and northern Georgia to determine their climatic response. We dated the samples using skeleton plots, measured the cores, and compared the site- and regional-level tree-ring chronologies of each separate species with divisional climate data. The oldest trees in each chronology dated back to 203 years for black oak, 299 years for chestnut oak, 171 years for northern red oak, 135 years for scarlet oak, and 291 years for white oak. We successfully developed climate models via multiple regression analyses with statistically significant (P < 0.05) variables representing the Palmer Drought Severity Index and average monthly temperature for most of the site-species chronologies (average R2 = 0.15). All regional climate response models included the Palmer Drought Severity Index from either June or July as the most significant variable in the climate response, suggesting that growing-season drought is the most important factor limiting oak growth in the southeastern US. An increase in temperature and reduction in moisture is likely to reduce their competitiveness in their current locations and force these species to migrate to cooler climates, thereby greatly changing ecosystem health and stability in the southern Appalachians. },

@article{Busing2005,
	Abstract = {A long-term study of tree mortality, canopy turnover, and coarse woody detritus inputs was conducted in cove forests of the Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee, USA. Seven old-growth stands were studied over a 10-yr period using 0.6--1.0 ha plots. Annual mortality of trees >10 cm dbh was 0.5--1.4\% among stands (mean 0.7\%). The highest mortality rate among canopy trees was exhibited by trees >80 cm dbh. An increase in mortality rate with canopy tree size was evident for two (Tsuga canadensis and Acer saccharum) of the three most abundant species in the forest. The increase in mortality with tree size had implications for canopy turnover and detritus input. Gap disturbance frequency was estimated at 0.008--0.019 forest area/yr, giving a return interval of ∼130 yr or less. Standing death was the most common mode of mortality (59\%). Annual rates of snag formation were 1.4 snags/ha for trees >10 cm dbh and 0.4 snags/ha for trees >50 cm dbh. The density of large snags (>50 cm dbh) was 5 snags/ha. Snags accounted for 8\% of the total standing tree basal area and 23\% of the coarse woody detritus mass (total of 48 Mg/ ha). The mean annual rate of coarse woody detritus input was 3.0 Mg/ha. A decay rate constant was estimated at 0.07, yielding a detritus half-life of 10 yr. Although mean mortality rates and canopy turnover in old cove forests were moderate in comparison with other old forests of eastern North America, input and accumulation of coarse woody detritus were high for the region. This resulted, in part, from the relatively large sizes attained by canopy trees and the fact that larger trees tended to suffer higher mortality. In comparison to forests worldwide, rates of mortality, canopy gap formation, and decay of coarse woody detritus were intermediate.},

	Abstract = {The onset of spring plant growth has shifted earlier in the year over the past several decades due to rising global temperatures. Earlier spring onset may cause phenological mismatches between the availability of plant resources and dependent animals, and potentially lead to more false springs, when subsequent freezing temperatures damage new plant growth. We used the extended spring indices to project changes in spring onset, defined by leaf out and by first bloom, and predicted false springs until 2100 in the conterminous United States (US) using statistically-downscaled climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 ensemble. Averaged over our study region, the median shift in spring onset was 23 days earlier in the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario with particularly large shifts in the Western US and the Great Plains. Spatial variation in phenology was due to the influence of short-term temperature changes around the time of spring onset versus season-long accumulation of warm temperatures. False spring risk increased in the Great Plains and portions of the Midwest, but remained constant or decreased elsewhere. We conclude that global climate change may have complex and spatially variable effects on spring onset and false springs, making local predictions of change difficult.},

	Abstract = {Forest mortality constitutes a major uncertainty in projections of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and carbon-cycle feedbacks. Recent drought-induced, widespread forest die-offs highlight that climate change could accelerate forest mortality with its diverse and potentially severe consequences for the global carbon cycle, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. How trees die during drought over multiple years remains largely unknown and precludes mechanistic modeling and prediction of forest die-off with climate change. Here, we examine the physiological basis of a recent multiyear widespread die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across much of western North America. Using observations from both native trees while they are dying and a rainfall exclusion experiment on mature trees, we measure hydraulic performance over multiple seasons and years and assess pathways of accumulated hydraulic damage. We test whether accumulated hydraulic damage can predict the probability of tree survival over 2 years. We find that hydraulic damage persisted and increased in dying trees over multiple years and exhibited few signs of repair. This accumulated hydraulic deterioration is largely mediated by increased vulnerability to cavitation, a process known as cavitation fatigue. Furthermore, this hydraulic damage predicts the probability of interyear stem mortality. Contrary to the expectation that surviving trees have weathered severe drought, the hydraulic deterioration demonstrated here reveals that surviving regions of these forests are actually more vulnerable to future droughts due to accumulated xylem damage. As the most widespread tree species in North America, increasing vulnerability to drought in these forests has important ramifications for ecosystem stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem carbon balance. Our results provide a foundation for incorporating accumulated drought impacts into climate-vegetation models. Finally, our findings highlight the critical role of drought stress accumulation and repair of stress-induced damage for avoiding plant mortality, presenting a dynamic and contingent framework for drought impacts on forest ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {P{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}1. Climate change is predicted to bring earlier bud break and perhaps a greater risk of frost damage to developing leaves and flowers. Given the rarity and unpredictability of major frost events and limited community-level phenological observations, comparisons among deciduous forest species experiencing frost damage and refoliation are rare. 2. This study used phenological observations ongoing at the time of a hard freeze to compare leaf and flower development, frost damage and leaf refoliation of 20 deciduous woody species in Trelease Woods, Champaign Co., IL, USA. Freezing temperatures from 5 to 9 April 2007 followed 22 days after very warm temperatures began in March. 3. Bud break was the earliest in 17 years. Frost caused damage to leaf buds, developing shoots and/or expanding leaves of canopy trees of six species and saplings of two species. Undamaged species were inactive, or in bud break or shoot expansion. Among damaged species, 11-100{\{}{\%}{\}} of individuals exhibited some frost damage. Mean damage level per individual ranged from 20{\{}{\%}{\}} to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} among species. 4. Refoliation from dormant buds led to mean final canopy fullness that ranged from 46{\{}{\%}{\}} to 99{\{}{\%}{\}} among damaged species, but time of full leaf expansion was extended by 16-34 days for refoliating species. 5. Frost damaged flowers, but not flower buds or developing fruit, of five of eight species that flowered during the frost period. 6. The extent of frost damage in 2007 was unusual; damage was greater than any of the other 4 years with frost damage from 1993 to 2009 because record-breaking March temperatures in 2007 caused more species to be at later vulnerable stages with the advent of subfreezing temperatures in April. 7. Differences among individuals and species in frost damage and ability to refoliate caused strong selection on individuals and differences in carbon gain that could, in the long-term, affect species' abundances. The frost also reduced fruit/seed abundance for insects and mammals.},

	Abstract = {Climate change, with both warmer spring temperatures and greater temperature fluctuations, has altered phenologies, possibly leading to greater risk of spring frost damage to temperate deciduous woody plants. Phenological observations of 20 woody species from 1993 to 2012 in Trelease Woods, Champaign County, Illinois, USA, were used to identify years with frost damage to vegetative and reproductive phases. Local temperature records were used in combination with the phenological observations to determine what combinations of the two were associated with damage. Finally, a long-term temperature record (1889-1992) was evaluated to determine if the frequency of frost damage has risen in recent decades. Frost {\{}{\textless}{\}} or = -1.7 degrees C occurred after bud-break in 14 of the 20 years of observation. Frost damage occurred in five years in the interior and in three additional years at only the forest edge. The degree of damage varied with species, life stage, tissue (vegetative or reproductive), and phenological phase. Common features associated with the occurrence of damage to interior plants were (1) a period of unusual warm temperatures in March, followed by (2) a frost event in April with a minimum temperature {\{}{\textless}{\}} or = -6.1 degrees C with (3) a period of 16-33 days between the extremes. In the long-term record, 10 of 124 years met these conditions, but the yearly probability of frost damage increased significantly, from 0.03 during 1889-1979 to 0.21 during 1980-2012. When the criteria were "softened" to {\{}{\textless}{\}} or = -1.7 degrees C in April and an interval of 16-37 days, 31 of 124 years met the conditions, and the yearly damage probability increased significantly to 0.19 for 1889-1979 and 0.42 for 1980-2012. In this forest, the combination of warming trends and temperature variability (extremes) associated with climate change is having ecologically important effects, making previously rare frost damage events more common.},

	Abstract = {Climate change is expected to modify the timing of seasonal transitions this century, impacting wildlife migrations, ecosystem function, and agricultural activity. Tracking seasonal transitions in a consistent manner across space and through time requires indices that can be used for monitoring and managing biophysical and ecological systems during the coming decades. Here a new gridded dataset of spring indices is described and used to understand interannual, decadal, and secular trends across the coterminous United States. This dataset is derived from daily interpolated meteorological data, and the results are compared with historical station data to ensure the trends and variations are robust. Regional trends in the first leaf index range from 20.8 to 21.6 days decade 21 , while first bloom index trends are between 20.4 and 21.2 for most regions. However, these trends are modulated by interannual to multidecadal variations, which are substantial throughout the regions considered here. These findings emphasize the important role large-scale climate modes of variability play in modulating spring onset on interannual to multidecadal time scales. Finally, there is some potential for successful subseasonal forecasts of spring onset, as indices from most regions are sig-nificantly correlated with antecedent large-scale modes of variability.},

	Abstract = {The timing of spring phenology of trees reflects a trade-off between a longer growing season and a lower risk for damage by late freezing events. Temperature is driving rates of development directly, but given the high inter-annual variability in weather, it is a poor environmental cue for the progression of the season and thus, the period with low freezing risk. In contrast, photoperiod is a reliable and weather independent signal of the progression of the season. Using growth chamber experiments we assessed the photoperiod sensitivity of bud burst under artificial spring conditions in cuttings of 14 common European tree species that belong to different life-strategy types (pioneers or exotic species vs. native late-successional species; 3 conifers/11 broadleaved). Fully chilled twigs were sampled from populations along two elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps. Applying realistic contrasts in photoperiod, short photoperiods delayed bud burst in five late successional species to variable degree, whereas no distinct photoperiod sensitivity was observed in early successional species. In Picea abies, the photoperiod response was additionally influenced by elevation of origin, whereas in Quercus petraea and Abies alba regional differences in the photoperiod response were observed. For late successional species, photoperiod is thus an important environmental signal that will constrain responses to climatic warming because rising temperatures will drive phenology toward the species specific photoperiod threshold. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Inter-annual variation in climate is reflected by changes in the timing of phenology. Over the last decades a considerable number of models have been developed in order to explain the inter-annual variation of spring phenology in trees. Contrary to empirical models, ``process-based'' models aim at simulating physiological processes in order to yield more realistic predictions of growing season onset dates. Despite the increasing knowledge on the environmental controls of seasonal dormancy in trees, the detailed action and interaction of the involved environmental drivers (chilling, photoperiod and warm temperature) remains to be elucidated. This study aims at a uniform comparison of a wide range of existing models (and new recombinations), on a multitude of long-term observation series in six tree species across central Europe, using extensive cross-validation. Even though the assessed models differ in the phases of dormancy and environmental drivers accounted for, they yielded a surprisingly similar quality of prediction of leaf unfolding dates. Depending on the species, the lowest average prediction errors for leaf unfolding (RMSE) ranged from 7 to 9 days for the dataset pooled across sites and years and from 4 to 6 days for site-specific predictions, in absence of any obvious geographical pattern. Simple models, that feature ecodormancy release only, performed similar or better than more complex models, which additionally include endodormancy release through chilling temperatures. Model parameterisation tended to converge towards similar behaviour and models with many parameters tended to overfit on the 40 year time-series of leaf unfolding. Additionally, all models tended to underestimate the inter-annual variation of leaf unfolding and failed to predict very early or late dates of leaf unfolding in certain years. The transfer of site-specific parameters to other sites was associated with an almost doubling of the average prediction error, independent of distance and climatic similarity between the calibration and validation sites. The findings challenge the accurate implementation of the physiological processes controlling spring phenology in the models and highlight shortcomings associated with model parameterisation on observational time-series only.},

	Abstract = {Stable isotope analysis (SIA) has proven to be a useful tool in reconstructing diets, characterizing trophic relationships, elucidating patterns of resource allocation, and constructing food webs. Consequently, the number of studies using SIA in trophic ecology has increased exponentially over the past decade. Several subdisciplines have developed, including isotope mixing models, incorporation dynamics models, lipid-extraction and correction methods, isotopic routing models, and compound-specific isotopic analysis. As with all tools, there are limitations to SIA. Chief among these are multiple sources of variation in isotopic signatures, unequal taxonomic and ecosystem coverage, over-reliance on literature values for key parameters, lack of canonical models, untested or unrealistic assumptions, low predictive power, and a paucity of experimental studies. We anticipate progress in SIA resulting from standardization of methods and models, calibration of model parameters through experimentation, and continued development of several recent approaches such as isotopic routing models and compound-specific isotopic analysis.},

	Abstract = {Volcanic eruptions have been hypothesized as an iron supply mechanism for phytoplankton blooms; however, little direct evidence of stimulatory responses has been obtained in the field. Here we present the results of twenty-one 1--2 day bottle enrichment experiments from cruises in the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean which conclusively demonstrated a photophysiological and biomass stimulation of phytoplankton communities following supply of basaltic or rhyolitic volcanic ash. Furthermore, experiments in the Southern Ocean demonstrated significant phytoplankton community responses to volcanic ash supply in the absence of responses to addition of dissolved iron alone. At these sites, dissolved manganese concentrations were among the lowest ever measured in seawater, and we therefore suggest that the enhanced response to ash may have been a result of the relief of manganese (co)limitation. Our results imply that volcanic ash deposition events could trigger extensive phytoplankton blooms, potentially capable of significant impacts on regional carbon cycling.},

@article{Caffarra2011,
	Abstract = {The process of adaptation is the result of stabilising selection caused by two opposite forces: protection against an unfavourable season (survival adaptation), and effective use of growing resources (capacity adaptation). As plant species have evolved different life strategies based on different trade offs between survival and capacity adaptations, different phenological responses are also expected among species. The aim of this study was to compare budburst responses of two opportunistic species (Betula pubescens, and Salix x smithiana) with that of two long-lived, late successional species (Fagus sylvatica and Tilia cordata) and consider their ecological significance. Thus, we performed a series of experiments whereby temperature and photoperiod were manipulated during dormancy. T. cordata and F. sylvatica showed low rates of budburst, high chilling requirements and responsiveness to light intensity, while B. pubescens and S. x smithiana had high rates of budburst, low chilling requirements and were not affected by light intensity. In addition, budburst in B. pubescens and S. x smithiana was more responsive to high forcing temperatures than in T. cordata and F. sylvatica. These results suggest that the timing of growth onset in B. pubescens and S. x smithiana (opportunistic) is regulated through a less conservative mechanism than in T. cordata and F. sylvatica (long-lived, late successional), and that these species trade a higher risk of frost damage for the opportunity of vigorous growth at the beginning of spring, before canopy closure. This information should be considered when assessing the impacts of climate change on vegetation or developing phenological models.},

Seedlings from 23 populations were treated in 12 growth-chamber combinations of chilling periods and flushing temperatures. Bud-burst rates increased approximately logarithmically with temperature. Rates also depended on the duration of chilling, with temperature coefficients (Q10) increasing from 2.7 after 11 days of chilling to 3.5 after 77 days. The annual temperature cycle, moisture relation, latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean of the site of origin of a population also influenced the rate of bud burst in the population under controlled conditions. The adaptive significance of these responses is discussed in terms of Levins's dormancy strategy hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {1. Harsh abiotic conditions -- such as low temperatures that lead to spring and summer frost events in high-elevation and high-latitude ecosystems -- can have strong negative consequences for plant growth, survival and reproduction. 2. Despite the predicted increase in episodic frost events under continued climate change in some ecosystems, our general understanding of the factors associated with frost sensitivity of reproductive and vegetative plant structures in natural plant communities is limited. The timing of growth and reproduction may be an important strategy by which plants can avoid frost. 3. In this study, we experimentally investigated the frost sensitivity of eight long-lived perennial herbaceous plant species from a subalpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA. The study taxa represent four congeneric pairs from four flowering plant families; within each pair, there is a species with early and late growth and reproductive phenology. Thus, we control for evolution- ary history -- and therefore additional traits shared through common ancestry -- to some degree, while examining the influence of phenology on frost sensitivity. Specifically, we compared frost sen- sitivity of vegetative and reproductive structures for each species and asked whether frost sensitivity was similar between species within congeneric pairs or, instead, was related to phenology (i.e. dif- ferences in the timing of growth and reproduction). 4. For most species (6 of 8), flowers were more sensitive to frost than leaves. Within most con- generic pairs (3 of 4), the leaves of species with later phenology were significantly more sensitive to frost than the leaves of species with earlier phenology. For flowers, the later flowering species were more sensitive in two of the four congeneric pairs. 5. Synthesis. This study contributes to our general understanding of factors related to interspecific differences in plant sensitivity to episodic frost events of naturally occurring species. The increased frost sensitivity of reproductive structures compared to vegetative structures may be a widespread pattern for long-lived perennial plants. Furthermore, we find evidence for a trade-off between phe- nology and frost sensitivity, whereby species with later phenology exhibit higher frost sensitivity compared to species with earlier phenology. These results have implications for plant populations, species interactions and ecological communities.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Temperate plants are at risk of being exposed to late spring freezes. These freeze events---often called false springs---are one of the strongest factors determining temperate plants species range limits and can impose high ecological and economic damage. As climate change may alter the prevalence and severity of false springs, our ability to forecast such events has become more critical, and it has led to a growing body of research. Many false spring studies largely simplify the myriad complexities involved in assessing false spring risks and damage. While these studies have helped advance the field and may provide useful estimates at large scales, studies at the individual to community levels must integrate more complexity for accurate predictions of plant damage from late spring freezes. Here we review current metrics of false spring, and how, when and where plants are most at risk of freeze damage. We highlight how life stage, functional group, species differences in morphology and phenology, and regional climatic differences contribute to the damage potential of false springs. More studies aimed at understanding relationships among species tolerance and avoidance strategies, climatic regimes, and the environmental cues that underlie spring phenology would improve predictions at all biological levels. An integrated approach to assessing past and future spring freeze damage would provide novel insights into fundamental plant biology, and offer more robust predictions as climate change progresses, which is essential for mitigating the adverse ecological and economic effects of false springs.

	Abstract = {As observed for most stresses, tree frost resistance can be split into two main processes: avoidance and tolerance. Avoidance of freezing is achieved by introducing species only in the climatic context in which the probability of freezing events is very low for the sensitive stages of buds or stems; i.e., when good synchronism exists between the annual cycle and the critical climatic periods. Buds become able to grow only after chilling requirements have been satisfied (endodormancy released) during winter; they subsequently break after heat requirements have been completed (end of ecodormancy) in early spring. Actually, this period is often subject to more or less severe freezing events. Trees are also able to adjust their freezing tolerance by increasing their capacity of extracellular freezing and decreasing the possibility of intracellular freezing through the process of frost acclimation. Both freezing resistance processes (avoidance and tolerance) are environmentally driven (by photoperiod and temperature), but there are also genotypic effects among species or cultivars. Here, we evaluated the degree to which differences in dormancy release and frost acclimation were related to environmental and genetic influences by comparing trees growing in common garden conditions. This investigation was carried out for two winters in lowland and mountain locations on different walnut genotypes differing significantly for budburst dates. Chilling requirement for endodormancy release and heat requirement during ecodormancy were evaluated in all situations. In addition, frost acclimation was assessed by the electrolyte leakage method on stems from the same trees before leaf fall through budburst. No significant differences were observed in chilling requirements among genotypes. Moreover, frost acclimation dynamics were similar between genotypes or locations when expressed depending on chilling units accumulated since 15 September as a time basis instead of Julian day. The only exception was for maximal frost hardiness observed during winter with the timber-oriented being significantly more resistant than fruit-oriented genotypes. Heat requirement was significantly different among genotypes. Thus, growth was significantly faster in fruit-oriented than in wood-oriented genotypes. Furthermore, among wood-oriented genotypes, differences in growth rate were observed only at cold temperatures. Frost acclimation changes differed significantly between fruit- and wood- walnuts from January through budburst. In conclusion, from September through January, the acclimation dynamic was driven mainly by environmental factors whereas from January through budburst a significant genotype effect was identified in both frost tolerance and avoidance processes.},

	Abstract = {Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

	Abstract = {Global warming is expected to have a major impact on plant distributions, an issue of key importance in biological conservation. However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species???quaking aspen and sugar maple???indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

	Abstract = {Plants are finely tuned to the seasonality of their environment, and shifts in the timing of plant activity (i.e. phenology) provide some of the most compelling evidence that species and ecosystems are being influenced by global environmental change. Researchers across disciplines have observed shifting phenology at multiple scales, including earlier spring flowering in individual plants and an earlier spring green-up' of the land surface revealed in satellite images. Experimental and modeling approaches have sought to identify the mechanisms causing these shifts, as well as to make predictions regarding the consequences. Here, we discuss recent advances in several fields that have enabled scaling between species responses to recent climatic changes and shifts in ecosystem productivity, with implications for global carbon cycling. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Abstract Spring heat accumulation plays a major role in the timing of events such as leaf-out, leaf expansion, flowering, and insect hatch in temperate systems. Accordingly, heat accumulation can serve as a proxy for the timing of plant and insect phenological activity and can be used in a predictive way when the timing of heat accumulation thresholds being reached can be anticipated. This has strong value for a host of planning and management applications. If relationships exist between earlier- and later-season thresholds at a location, then the timing of later-season phenological events that are forced by the accumulation of warmth could be anticipated based on when earlier-season thresholds are met. Using high-resolution daily temperature data, we calculated the coherence in pairs of spring-season heat accumulation (growing degree day) threshold anomalies over 1948--2016. Overall, relationships between thresholds spanning the entire spring season were relatively low, while later season thresholds exhibited much higher correlations. This pattern is generally the result of decreasing variability in heat accumulation with season progression. However, correlation strengths did not follow latitudinal or gradients, revealing that within-season heat accumulation and interannual variability in threshold timing are unique to the specified base temperature and thresholds being compared. We show that the relationships between earlier- and later-season heat accumulation thresholds were sufficient to accurately predict the timing of phenological events in plants in two case examples.},

Generation of site- and taxon-specific models is limited by the intensive in-situ phenological monitoring effort required to generate sufficient data to parameterize each model. Where in-situ phenological observations exist, the data are often subject to analytical issues due to the limited duration of any individual monitoring program, spotty site- and species- level coverage, lack of standardized methodology, and infrequent or variable census intervals. Together, these characteristics constrain our ability to make phenological inferences outside of select sites and taxa where long-duration, intensive monitoring has occurred. In this study, we leveraged two national, standardized phenology datasets to develop a multi-species and multi-site state-space survival model of the onset of deciduous tree and shrub spring (leaf out) and fall (leaf-color) events across temperate ecoregions of the United States. We used data from two national-scale phenological databases, a 9-year, broadly distributed dataset from the USA National Phenology Network and a 4-year dataset from the National Ecological Observatory Network, to quantify regional and interspecific variation in sensitivity to environmental drivers for both spring and fall leaf phenophases. Spring leaf out was generally promoted by longer days, spring growing degree day accumulation, overwinter chilling, and was suppressed by frost events, whereas fall leaf color was promoted by shorter days and cold accumulation. The sensitivity to most environmental drivers tended to be more variable among species than among the regions as defined here (EPA ecoregions of North America, excluding desert and tropical areas). The results of this study lay the groundwork for incorporating the growing collection of phenological observations into a generalized framework for predicting the transition states for any species, in any location.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Leaf senescence in winter deciduous species signals the transition from the active to the dormant stage. The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. Photoperiod and temperature are the main cues controlling leaf senescence in winter deciduous species, with water stress imposing an additional influence. Photoperiod exerts a strict control on leaf senescence at latitudes where winters are severe and temperature gains importance in the regulation as winters become less severe. On average, climatic warming will delay and drought will advance leaf senescence, but at varying degrees depending on the species. Warming and drought thus have opposite effects on the phenology of leaf senescence, and the impact of climate change will therefore depend on the relative importance of each factor in specific regions. Warming is not expected to have a strong impact on nutrient proficiency although a slower speed of leaf senescence induced by warming could facilitate a more efficient nutrient resorption. Nutrient resorption is less efficient when the leaves senesce prematurely as a consequence of water stress. The overall effects of climate change on nutrient resorption will depend on the contrasting effects of warming and drought. Changes in nutrient resorption and proficiency will impact production in the following year, at least in early spring, because the construction of new foliage relies almost exclusively on nutrients resorbed from foliage during the preceding leaf fall. Changes in the phenology of leaf senescence will thus impact carbon uptake, but also ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially if the changes are consequence of water stress.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Timing of leaf out in woody plants is being affected by global climate change, with cascading effects on associated organisms and ecosystem processes. However, the timing and responsiveness of this important phenological event are not well understood, especially in relation to the geographic origin of species and populations. This study assessed the effect of anomalous spring warming on leaf out timing for woody plant species and individuals from a range of taxa and geographic origins. Timing of leaf out was assessed across 4 years (2011--2014) for 478 plants, representing 96 species and 21 genera, planted together in a common environment at The Morton Arboretum, Lisle, Illinois, USA. An anomalously warm spring in 2012 strongly affected leaf out timing, advancing mean leaf out date for every species by an average of 31 days across all individuals. Responsiveness was related to species traits, as species classified as early-successional, with diffuse-porous wood anatomy, or with a weak chilling requirement were much more responsive. There was strong variation among individuals within a species in leaf out timing and responsiveness. These patterns were somewhat related to geographical origin of the individual, but were not consistent among species or genera. High responsiveness of leaf out to anomalous spring warming, which is forecasted to be more common with global climate change, could have important implications for climate change adaptation, assisted migration, and ecological interactions. Chilling requirements may have limited responsiveness for some species, which could affect competitive dynamics within plant communities. Through such interactions and direct effects on woody plant species, variation in spring leaf out phenology will likely affect biodiversity and functioning in many ecosystems.},

@article{Foley1998,
	Abstract = {Abstract Numerous studies have underscored the importance of terrestrial ecosystems as an integral component of the Earth's climate system. This realization has already led to efforts to link simple equilibrium vegetation models with Atmospheric General Circulation Models through iterative coupling procedures. While these linked models have pointed to several possible climate?vegetation feedback mechanisms, they have been limited by two shortcomings: (i) they only consider the equilibrium response of vegetation to shifting climatic conditions and therefore cannot be used to explore transient interactions between climate and vegetation; and (ii) the representations of vegetation processes and land-atmosphere exchange processes are still treated by two separate models and, as a result, may contain physical or ecological inconsistencies. Here we present, as a proof concept, a more tightly integrated framework for simulating global climate and vegetation interactions. The prototype coupled model consists of the GENESIS (version 2) Atmospheric General Circulation Model and the IBIS (version 1) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. The two models are directly coupled through a common treatment of land surface and ecophysiological processes, which is used to calculate the energy, water, carbon, and momentum fluxes between vegetation, soils, and the atmosphere. On one side of the interface, GENESIS simulates the physics and general circulation of the atmosphere. On the other side, IBIS predicts transient changes in the vegetation structure through changes in the carbon balance and competition among plants within terrestrial ecosystems. As an initial test of this modelling framework, we perform a 30?year simulation in which the coupled model is supplied with modern CO2 concentrations, observed ocean temperatures, and modern insolation. In this exploratory study, we run the GENESIS atmospheric model at relatively coarse horizontal resolution (4.5$\,^{\circ}$latitude by 7.5$\,^{\circ}$longitude) and IBIS at moderate resolution (2$\,^{\circ}$latitude by 2$\,^{\circ}$longitude). We initialize the models with globally uniform climatic conditions and the modern distribution of potential vegetation cover. While the simulation does not fully reach equilibrium by the end of the run, several general features of the coupled model behaviour emerge. We compare the results of the coupled model against the observed patterns of modern climate. The model correctly simulates the basic zonal distribution of temperature and precipitation, but several important regional biases remain. In particular, there is a significant warm bias in the high northern latitudes, and cooler than observed conditions over the Himalayas, central South America, and north-central Africa. In terms of precipitation, the model simulates drier than observed conditions in much of South America, equatorial Africa and Indonesia, with wetter than observed conditions in northern Africa and China. Comparing the model results against observed patterns of vegetation cover shows that the general placement of forests and grasslands is roughly captured by the model. In addition, the model simulates a roughly correct separation of evergreen and deciduous forests in the tropical, temperate and boreal zones. However, the general patterns of global vegetation cover are only approximately correct: there are still significant regional biases in the simulation. In particular, forest cover is not simulated correctly in large portions of central Canada and southern South America, and grasslands extend too far into northern Africa. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of coupling climate models with fully dynamic representations of the terrestrial biosphere. Continued development of fully coupled climate-vegetation models will facilitate the exploration of a broad range of global change issues, including the potential role of vegetation feedbacks within the climate system, and the impact of climate variability and transient climate change on the terrestrial biosphere.},

	Abstract = {Air temperatures play a major role on temperate fruit development, and the projected future warming may thereby bring additional threats. The present study aims at analyzing the impacts of climate change on chilling and heat forcing on European vineyards and olive (V\&O) orchards. Chilling portions (CP) and growing degree hours (GDH) were computed yearly for the recent past (1989--2005) and the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 future scenarios (2021--2080), using several regional-global climate models, also considering model uncertainties and biases. Additionally, minimum CP and GDH values found in 90{\%} of all years were also computed. These metrics were then extracted to the current location of V\&O in Europe, and CP-GDH delimitations were assessed. For recent past, high CP values are found in north-central European regions, while lower values tend to exist on opposite sides of Europe. Regarding forcing, southern European regions currently show the highest GDH values. Future projections point to an increased warming, particularly under RCP8.5 and for 2041 onwards. A lower/higher CP is projected for south-western/eastern Europe, while most of Europe is projected to have higher GDH. Northern-central European V\&O orchards should still have future CP-GDH similar to present values, while most of southern European orchards are expected to have much lower CP and higher GDH, especially under RCP8.5. These changes may bring limitations to some of the world most important V\&O producers, such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. The planning of suitable adaptation measures against these threats is critical for the future sustainability of the European V\&O sectors.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how changing climate, nutrient regimes, and invasive species shift food web structure is critically important in ecology. Most analytical approaches, however, assume static species interactions and environmental effects across time. Therefore, we applied multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models in a moving window context to test for shifting plankton community interactions and effects of environmental variables on plankton abundance in Lake Washington, U.S.A. from 1962-1994, following reduced nutrient loading in the 1960s and the rise of Daphnia in the 1970s. The moving-window MAR (mwMAR) approach showed shifts in the strengths of interactions between Daphnia, a dominant grazer, and other plankton taxa between a high nutrient, Oscillatoria-dominated regime and a low nutrient, Daphnia-dominated regime. The approach also highlighted the inhibiting influence of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria on other plankton taxa in the community. Overall community stability was lowest during the period of elevated nutrient loading and Oscillatoria dominance. Despite recent warming of the lake, we found no evidence that anomalous temperatures impacted plankton abundance. Our results suggest mwMAR modeling is a useful approach that can be applied across diverse ecosystems, when questions involve shifting relationships within food webs, and among species and abiotic drivers.},

	Abstract = {Phenology models are tools to analyze changes in the timing and duration of the growing season. During the past three decades different budburst models have been developed, but, so far, no consensus model has been found to accurately predict budburst date across different tree species. The aim of this study was to estimate the performance of six different temperature-driven models of leaf budburst (thermal time, thermal period fixed, sequential, parallel, alternating, unified) for four temperate tree species in Belgium (birch, chestnut, oak, beech). The models were parameterized using a Bayesian approach. The performance of these models was compared using Bayesian model comparison (BMC) and root mean square error (RMSE).Model comparison showed that the two models that do not include a calculation of chilling requirement were the best for the studied four tree species. The Sequential model (SM) was the third most plausible model for predicting budburst, having a higher probability to be correct than the other two-phase models combining a chilling phase with a forcing phase. This suggested that in our budburst observation dataset, the chilling requirement was probably always fulfilled, making the date of budburst controlled by forcing temperature. We cannot rule out that in warmer regions or future warmer conditions, chilling may become insufficient and a sequential pattern of chilling and forcing may become most appropriate to simulate budburst date. Parameter analysis showed that the last month prior to budburst had the greatest impact on determining the date of bud opening in the case of birch and chestnut, whereas the last 3 months were the main determinants for oak and beech, the two later flushing species. Validation showed that the models that fitted the parameterization data well had much poorer performance when tested with independent data. This indicates that other factors (e.g. photoperiod) might affect the budburst process and/or model parameterization (determining the sensitivity of budburst to temperature) substantially change between different localities. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Peatlands are important sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) that, in response to climate warming, are undergoing dynamic vegetation succession. Here we examined the hypothesis that the uptake of nutrients by different plant growth forms (PGFs) is one key mechanism driving changes in species abundance in peatlands. Along an altitude gradient representing a natural climate experiment, we compared the variability of the stable C isotope composition ({\$}\delta{\$}(13)C) and stable nitrogen (N) isotope composition ({\$}\delta{\$}(15)N) in current-year leaves of two major PGFs, i.e. ericoids and graminoids. The climate gradient was associated with a gradient of vascular plant cover, which was parallelled by different concentrations of organic and inorganic N as well as the fungal/bacterial ratio in peat. In both PGFs the (13)C natural abundance showed a marginal spatial decrease with altitude and a temporal decrease with progression of the growing season. Our data highlight a primary physical control of foliar {\$}\delta{\$}(13)C signature, which is independent from the PGFs. Natural abundance of foliar (15)N did not show any seasonal pattern and only in the ericoids showed depletion at lower elevation. This decreasing {\$}\delta{\$}(15)N pattern was primarily controlled by the higher relative availability of organic versus inorganic N and, only for the ericoids, by an increased proportion of fungi to bacteria in soil. Our space-for-time approach demonstrates that a change in abundance of PGFs is associated with a different strategy of nutrient acquisition (i.e. transfer via mycorrhizal symbiosis versus direct fine-root uptake), which could likely promote observed and predicted dwarf shrub expansion under climate change.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Plant ecologists have long been concerned with a seemingly paradoxical scenario in the relationship between plant growth and climate change: warming may actually increase the risk of plant frost damage. The underlying hypothesis is that mild winters and warm, early springs, which are expected to occur as the climate warms, may induce premature plant development, resulting in exposure of vulnerable plant tissues and organs to subsequent late-season frosts. The 2007 spring freeze in the eastern United States provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate this hypothesis and assess its large-scale consequences. In this article, we contrast the rapid prefreeze phenological advancement caused by unusually warm conditions with the dramatic postfreeze setback, and report complicated patterns of freeze damage to plants. The widespread devastation of crops and natural vegetation occasioned by this event demonstrates the need to consider large fluctuations in spring temperatures a real threat to terrestrial ecosystem structure and functioning in a warming climate.},

	Abstract = {The conference on Global Change and the World's Mountains held in Perth, Scotland, in 2010 offered a unique opportunity to analyze the state and progress of mountain research and its contribution to sustainable mountain development, as well as to reflect on required reorientations of research agendas. In this paper we provide the results of a three-step assessment of the research presented by 450 researchers from around the world. First, we determined the state of the art of mountain research and categorized it based on the analytical structure of the Global Land Project (GLP 2005). Second, we identified emerging themes for future research. Finally, we assessed the contribution of mountain research to sustainable development along the lines of the Grand Challenges in Global Sustainability Research (International Council for Science 2010). Analysis revealed that despite the growing recognition of the importance of more integrative research (inter- and transdisciplinary), the research community gathered in Perth still focuses on environmental drivers of change and on interactions within ecological systems. Only a small percentage of current research seeks to enhance understanding of social systems and of interactions between social and ecological systems. From the ecological systems perspective, a greater effort is needed to disentangle and assess different drivers of change and to investigate impacts on the rendering of ecosystem services. From the social systems perspective, significant shortcomings remain in understanding the characteristics, trends, and impacts of human movements to, within, and out of mountain areas as a form of global change. Likewise, sociocultural drivers affecting collective behavior as well as incentive systems devised by policy and decision makers are little understood and require more in-depth investigation. Both the complexity of coupled social--ecological systems and incomplete data sets hinder integrated systems research. Increased understanding of linkages and feedbacks between social and ecological systems will help to identify nonlinearities and thresholds (tipping points) in both system types. This presupposes effective collaboration between ecological and social sciences. Reflections on the Grand Challenges in Sustainability Research put forth by the International Council for Science (2010) reveal the need to intensify research on effective responses and innovations. This will help to achieve sustainable development in mountain regions while maintaining the core competence of mountain research in forecasting and observation.},

	Abstract = {Climate warming has increased researchers' interest in plant phenology and its modelling. Although the main focus is on projections of accelerated springtime phenological events, also a further extension of the growing season by delayed growth cessation is often projected. However, ecophysiological studies indicate that, for boreal and temperate trees, such generalisations are precluded owing to differential climatic conditions and inter- and intraspecific genetic differences. The annual cycle of these trees is an integrated system, where one phase affects subsequent phases, resulting in delayed impacts, which are only partially addressed in current ecophysiological models. Here, we outline an updated integrated conceptual model of the annual cycle by identifying ecophysiological phenomena that are particularly significant under climate warming.},

	Abstract = {The effect of temperature during short-day (SD) dormancy induction was examined in three boreal tree species in a controlled environment. Saplings of Betula pendula Roth, B. pubescens Ehrh. and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Moench. were exposed to 5 weeks of 10-h SD induction at 9, 15 and 21 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C followed by chilling at 5 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C for 40, 70, 100 and 130 days and subsequent forcing at 15 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C in a 24-h photoperiod for 60 days. In all species and with all chilling periods, high temperature during SD dormancy induction significantly delayed bud burst during subsequent flushing at 15 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C. In A. glutinosa, high temperature during SD dormancy induction also significantly increased the chilling requirement for dormancy release. Field experiments at 60{\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}} N with a range of latitudinal birch populations revealed a highly significant correlation between autumn temperature and days to bud burst in the subsequent spring. September temperature alone explained 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variation between years in time of bud burst. In birch populations from 69 and 71{\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}} N, which ceased growing and shed their leaves in August when the mean temperature was 15 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C, bud burst occurred later than expected compared with lower latitude populations (56{\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}} N) in which dormancy induction took place more than 2 months later at a mean temperature of about 6 {\{}{\{}{\}}degrees{\{}{\}}{\}}C. It is concluded that this autumn temperature response may be important for counterbalancing the potentially adverse effects of higher winter temperatures on dormancy stability of boreal trees during climate warming.},

	Abstract = {In the spring of 2010, temperatures averaged similar to 3 similar to degrees C above the long-term mean (MarchMay) across the northeastern United States. However, in mid-to-late spring, much of this region experienced a severe frost event. The spring of 2010 therefore provides a case study on how future spring temperature extremes may affect northeastern forest ecosystems. We assessed the response of three northern hardwood tree species (sugar maple, American beech, yellow birch) to these anomalous temperature patterns using several different data sources and addressed four main questions: (1) Along an elevational gradient, how was each species affected by the late spring frost? (2) How did differences in phenological growth strategy influence their response? (3) How did the late spring frost affect ecosystem productivity within the study domain? (4) What are the potential long-term impacts of spring frost events on forest community ecology? Our results show that all species exhibited early leaf development triggered by the warm spring. However, yellow birch and American beech have more conservative growth strategies and were largely unaffected by the late spring frost. In contrast, sugar maples responded strongly to warmer temperatures and experienced widespread frost damage that resulted in leaf loss and delayed canopy development. Late spring frost events may therefore provide a competitive advantage for yellow birch and American beech at the expense of sugar maple. Results from satellite remote sensing confirm that frost damage was widespread throughout the region at higher elevations ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}500 similar to m). The frost event is estimated to have reduced gross ecosystem productivity by 70153 similar to g similar to C similar to m-2, or 714{\{}{\%}{\}} of the annual gross productivity (1061 similar to+/-similar to 82 similar to g similar to C similar to m-2) across 8753 similar to km2 of high-elevation forest. We conclude that frost events following leaf out, which are expected to become more common with climate change, may influence both forest composition and ecosystem productivity.},

	Abstract = {P{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}Plant phenology is particularly sensitive to climate and a key indicator of environmental change. Globally, first flowering dates (FFDs) have advanced by several days per decade in response to recent climate warming, but, while earlier flowering should allow plant distributions to increase, a link between FFD and range changes has not been observed. Here I show for 347 species that the extent to which FFD has responded to climate warming is linked to the degree to which their relative distributions have changed over 30 yr across the British Isles. Native plant species whose phenology did not track climate change declined in distribution, whereas species that became more widespread all exhibited earlier flowering. In contrast, alien neophytes showed both a stronger phenological response to warming and a more marked increase in distribution, but no link between the two. These trends were consistent both for relative changes in the national distribution and for local abundance. At the national scale, the more recently an alien species became established in Britain, the more likely it was to increase in distribution irrespective of FFD, suggesting that recent changes in alien species distributions are decoupled from climate and driven by other factors.},

@article{Hunter1992,
	Abstract = {{$[$}1. Four models for predicting budburst in northern hardwood trees, based on response to spring warming alone, or with the response to spring warming modified by winter chilling and photoperiod, were compared. An historical, 18-year budburst record, and artificial datasets with budburst dates generated according to each of four conceptual models, were used to analyse the abilities of the models to predict budburst dates. 2. The four models all gave better predictions than could be obtained by taking the average date of budburst of a species. The historical budburst dates were most accurately predicted by models based only on spring warming from a fixed start date, or from a start date determined by the satisfaction of a chilling requirement. A photothermal model was only useful for species with late budburst dates, and gave relatively little improvement over the average date of budburst as a predictor. 3. Analysis of artificial datasets, in which budburst dates were generated according to the biological assumptions of each conceptual model, reveals little connection between the ability to predict budburst with accuracy and the underlying biological response to temperature. This should be a general caveat to modellers; even biologically incorrect models can give reasonably good predictions of budburst phenology.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {The effects that below-freezing temperature (frost) can have at times of year when it is unusual are an interesting ecological phenomenon that has received little attention. The physiological consequence of formation of ice crystals in plant tissue is often death of the plants, or at least of sensitive parts that can include flower buds, ovaries, and leaves. The loss of potential for sexual reproduction can have long-lasting effects on the demography of annuals and long-lived perennials, because the short-term negative effects of frosts can result in longer-term benefits through lowered populations of seed predators. The loss of host plants can have dramatic consequences for herbivores, even causing local extinctions, and the loss of just flowers can also affect populations of seed predators and their parasitoids. Frosts can cause local extinctions and influence the geographical distribution of some species. The potential for global climate change to influence the frequency and distribution of frost events is uncertain, but it seems likely that they may become more frequent in some areas and less frequent in others.},

We compared surveys of plant cover that were made in 1977 and 2006-2007 along a 2,314-m elevation gradient in Southern California's Santa Rosa Mountains. Southern California's climate warmed at the surface, the precipitation variability increased, and the amount of snow decreased during the 30-year period preceding the second survey. We found that the average elevation of the dominant plant species rose by approximately 65 m between the surveys. This shift cannot be attributed to changes in air pollution or fire frequency and appears to be a consequence of changes in regional climate.},

	Abstract = {To understand the development of cold hardiness in highbush blueberry plants (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), we investigated seasonal changes in the protein compositions of current-year and overwintered shoots. Electrophoresis using SDS-polyacrylamide gels indicated that the amounts of a few proteins increased in autumn, in association with an enhancement of cold hardiness. Of these proteins, 65- and 60-kDa proteins were confirmed to be dehydrins by western blotting. While the levels of most of the accumulated proteins decreased in April, a 27-kDa protein maintained its level in the overwintered stem during spring. The amino acid sequence deduced from a cDNA for this protein showed significant similarities with known chitinases. The stem segments from overwintered shoots sampled in July showed higher cold hardiness against sub-zero temperature than those from current-year shoots, and the bark tissue of overwintered shoots had higher cold resistance than that of current-year shoots. The 27-kDa protein (BC27) was mostly found in the bark tissue of stems. Appreciable accumulation of this protein in floral buds was not detected. The purified BC27 protein exerted a cryoprotective effect on protoplasts subjected to a freeze-thaw treatment. These results suggest that the stems of highbush blueberry develop a system of cold hardiness different from that of the buds and apices, and that the accumulation of chitinase is involved in tolerance to low temperature in winter or unseasonably low temperature in spring. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {In deciduous forests, spring leaf phenology controls the onset of numerous ecosystem functions. While most studies have focused on a single annual spring event, such as budburst, ecosystem functions like photosynthesis and transpiration increase gradually after budburst, as leaves grow to their mature size. Here, we examine the ``velocity of green-up,'' or duration between budburst and leaf maturity, in deciduous forest ecosystems of eastern North America. We use a diverse data set that includes 301 site-years of phenocam data across a range of sites, as well as 22 years of direct ground observations of individual trees and 3 years of fine-scale high-frequency aerial photography, both from Harvard Forest. We find a significant association between later start of spring and faster green-up: −{\thinspace}0.47{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.04 (slope{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}1 SE) days change in length of green-up for every day later start of spring within phenocam sites, −{\thinspace}0.31{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.06 days/day for trees under direct observation, and −{\thinspace}1.61{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.08 days/day spatially across fine-scale landscape units. To explore the climatic drivers of spring leaf development, we fit degree-day models to the observational data from Harvard Forest. We find that the default phenology parameters of the ecosystem model PnET make biased predictions of leaf initiation (39 days early) and maturity (13 days late) for red oak, while the optimized model has biases of 1 day or less. Springtime productivity predictions using optimized parameters are closer to results driven by observational data (within 1{\%}) than those of the default parameterization (17{\%} difference). Our study advances empirical understanding of the link between early and late spring phenophases and demonstrates that accurately modeling these transitions is important for simulating seasonal variation in ecosystem productivity.},

	Abstract = {Analyses of climate model simulations and observations reveal that extreme cold events are likely to persist across each land-continent even under 21st-century warming scenarios. The grid-based intensity, duration and frequency of cold extreme events are calculated annually through three indices: the coldest annual consecutive three-day average of daily maximum temperature, the annual maximum of consecutive frost days, and the total number of frost days. Nine global climate models forced with a moderate greenhouse-gas emissions scenario compares the indices over 20912100 versus 19912000. The credibility of model-simulated cold extremes is evaluated through both bias scores relative to reanalysis data in the past and multi-model agreement in the future. The number of times the value of each annual index in 20912100 exceeds the decadal average of the corresponding index in 19912000 is counted. The results indicate that intensity and duration of grid-based cold extremes, when viewed as a global total, will often be as severe as current typical conditions in many regions, but the corresponding frequency does not show this persistence. While the models agree on the projected persistence of cold extremes in terms of global counts, regionally, inter-model variability and disparity in model performance tends to dominate. Our findings suggest that, despite a general warming trend, regional preparedness for extreme cold events cannot be compromised even towards the end of the century.},

	Abstract = {* It has long been hypothesized that species are limited to the north by minimum temperature and to the south by competition, resulting in a trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate. We investigated the extent to which the climatic origins of populations from four live oak species (Quercus series Virentes) were associated with freezing tolerance and growth rate, and whether species fitted a model of locally adapted populations, each with narrow climatic tolerances, or of broadly adapted populations with wide climatic tolerances. * Acorns from populations of four species across a tropical-temperate gradient were grown under common tropical and temperate conditions. Growth rate, seed mass, and leaf and stem freezing traits were compared with source minimum temperatures. * Maximum growth rates under tropical conditions were negatively correlated with freezing tolerance under temperate conditions. The minimum source temperature predicted the freezing tolerance of populations under temperate conditions. The tropical species Q. oleoides was differentiated from the three temperate species, and variation among species was greater than among populations. * The trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate supports the range limit hypothesis. Limited variation within species indicates that the distributions of species may be driven more strongly by broad climatic factors than by highly local conditions.},

	Abstract = {1.Attempts at explaining range limits of temperate tree species still rest on correlations with climatic data that lack a physiological justification. Here we present a synthesis of a multidisciplinary project that offers mechanistic explantions. Employing climatology, biogeography, dendrology, population and reproduction biology, stress physiology and phenology, we combine results from in situ elevational (Swiss Alps) and latitudinal (Alps versus Scandinavia) comparisons, from reciprocal common garden and phytotron studies for 8 European broadleaf tree species. 2.We show that unlike for low stature plants, tree canopy temperatures can be predicted from weather station data, and that low temperature extremes in winter do not explain range limits. At the current low temperature range limit, all species recruit well. Transplants revealed that the local environment rather than elevation of seed origin dominates growth and phenology. Tree ring width at the range limit is not related to season length, but to growing season temperature, with no evidence of carbon shortage. Bud break and leaf emergence in adults trees are timed in such a way that the probability of freezing damage is almost zero, with a uniform safety margin across elevations and taxa. More freezing-resistant species flush earlier than less resistant species. 3.Synthesis: we conclude that the range limits of the examined tree species are set by the interactive influence of freezing resistance in spring, phenology settings, and the time required to mature tissue. Microevolution of spring phenology compromises between demands set by freezing resistance of young, immature tissue and season length requirements related to autumnal tissue maturation.

	Abstract = {Because climate change alters patterns of vegetative growth, long-term phenological measurements and observations can provide important data for analyzing its impact. Phenological assessments are usually made as records of calendar dates when specific phase changes occur. Such assessments have benefits and are used in Citizen Science monitoring. However, these kinds of data often have low statistical precision when describing gradual changes. Frequent monitoring of the phenological traits of forest trees and berries as they undergo gradual change is needed to acquire good temporal resolution of transitions relative to other factors, such as susceptibility to frosts, insects, and fungi, and the use of berries as a food resource. Intensive weekly monitoring of the growth of apical and branch buds and the elongation of shoots and leaves on four tree species, and the abundance of flowers and berries of bilberry and lingonberry, has been performed in Sweden since 2006. Here, we present quantitative methods for interpolating such data, which detail the gradual changes between assessments in order to describe average rates of development and amount of interannual variation. Our analysis has shown the active growth period of trees to differ with latitude. We also observed a change in the timing of the maximum numbers of ripening berries and their successive decline. Data from tree phenology assessments can be used to recommend best forestry practice and to model tree growth, while berry data can be used to estimate when food resources for animals are most available.},

	Abstract = {Warming temperatures are advancing the timing of seasonal vegetation development in the extratropics, altering plant--animal interactions and increasing the risk of trophic asynchrony. Forest understories are critical yet under-observed ecosystems in which phenological patterns are both altered and obscured by overstory trees. We address the challenge of observing phenological dynamics in the understory by exploiting the physiological relationship between plant phenology and temperature accumulation, a horticultural principle we show to be preserved across spatial scales through a combination of field and growth-chamber observations. These observations provide the foundation for a spaceborne thermal-observation framework, which can trace the discrete phenophases of forest understory plants in near-real time. The thermal basis of this framework also enables the prediction of understory phenology for future climates, which we demonstrate here using Shepherdia canadensis, a widespread fruiting shrub of western North America that has important trophic connections to frugivores. Our approach enables researchers to assess the regional-scale impacts of climate change on bottom-up forest ecosystems and to monitor emerging trophic mismatches.},

	Abstract = {Minimum temperature is assumed to be an important driver of tree species range limits. We investigated during which period of the year trees are most vulnerable to freezing damage and whether the pressure of freezing events increases with increasing elevation. We assessed the course of freezing resistance of buds and leaves from winter to summer at the upper elevational limits of eight deciduous tree species in the Swiss Alps. By reconstructing the spring phenology of these species over the last eight decades using a thermal time model, we linked freezing resistance with long-term minimum temperature data along elevational gradients. Counter-intuitively, the pressure of freeze events does not increase with elevation, but deciduous temperate tree species exhibit a constant safety margin (5-8.5 K) against damage by spring freeze events along elevational gradients, as a result of the later flushing at higher elevation. Absolute minimum temperatures in winter and summer are unlikely to critically injure trees. Our study shows that freezing temperatures in spring are the main selective pressure controlling the timing of flushing, leading to a shorter growing season at higher elevation and potentially driving species distribution limits. Such mechanistic knowledge is important to improve predictions of tree species range limits.},

	Abstract = {1. Within the same forest stand, temperate deciduous trees generally exhibit a distinct pattern in leaf-out timing, with some species flushing earlier than other species. This study aimed to explain the timing of leaf-out of various temperate tree species in relation to the risk of freezing damage to leaves. 2. We combined long-term series of leaf-out date (14--32 years) of five temperate tree species located in both low and high elevations in Switzerland, daily minimum temperatures recorded on the same sites and species-specific freezing resistance (LT50) of emerging leaves. We calculated temperature safety margins (the temperature difference between absolute minimum temperature during leaf-out and speciesspecific LT50 values), and date safety margins (time lag between the last day when temperature falls below species-specific LT50 values and the date of leaf-out). 3. The timing of leaf-out occurred when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero, irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs. high elevation) and species (early and late flushing species). In other words, trees leaf-out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period. Interestingly, the temperature safety margins did not differ significantly between low and high elevation. Yet, the date safety margin was smaller at high elevation, presumably due to a faster increase of temperature during the leaf-out period at high elevation. 4. When species-specific freezing resistance is taken into account, the time of leaf-out converges among species towards a marginal risk of freezing damage. Thus, leaf-out time has likely evolved in a way that the risk of freezing damage is minimized over a large spectrum of climatic conditions. Species with a small safety margin against freezing temperature, like Fagus sylvatica, appear to employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology, whereas species with a large safety margin depend largely on temperature for the right timing of leaf-out. 5. Our results offer a new avenue to explain the differences in leaf-out timing among cooccurring tree species. They further suggest that in a warming climate, tree species can expand their distribution range to the extent their phenology matches the stochasticity of freezing temperatures in spring.},

	Abstract = {Near-record warmth over much of the United States during March 2007 promoted early growth of crops and vegetation. A widespread arctic air outbreak followed in early April, resulting in extensive agricultural losses over much of the south-central and southeastern US. This 'false spring' event also resulted in widespread damage to newly grown tissues of native deciduous forest species, shown by previous researchers to have had measurable effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The current study reconstructed the historical occurrence of false springs over most of the southeastern quarter of the conterminous US (32--39{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}N; 75--98{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}W) from 1901 to 2007 using daily maximum and minimum temperature records from 176 stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network database, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. A false spring index was derived that examined the timing of the start of the growing season (SGS), or leaf emergence, relative to the timing of a potentially damaging last hard freeze (minimum temperature ≤ − 2.2 {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C). SGS was modeled for the domain by combining EVI data with ground-based temperature 'degree day' calculations reflecting the rate of springtime warming. No significant area-wide, long-term SGS trend was found; however, over much of a contiguous region stretching from Mississippi eastward to the Carolinas, the timing of the last hard freeze was found to occur significantly later, this change occurring along with increased frequency of false springs. Earlier last hard freeze dates and decreased frequency of false springs were found over much of the northwestern part of the study region, including Arkansas and southern Missouri.},

@article{Menzel2015,
	Abstract = {Damage by late spring frost is a risk deciduous trees have to cope with in order to optimize the length of their growing season. The timing of spring phenological development plays a crucial role, not only at the species level, but also at the population and individual level, since fresh new leaves are especially vulnerable. For the pronounced late spring frost in May 2011 in Germany, we studied the individual leaf development of 35 deciduous trees (mainly European beech Fagus sylvatica L.) at a mountainous forest site in the Bayerischer Wald National Park using repeated digital photographs. Analyses of the time series of greenness by a novel Bayesian multiple change point approach mostly revealed five change points which almost perfectly matched the expected break points in leaf development: (i) start of the first greening between day of the year (DOY) 108--119 (mean 113), (ii) end of greening, and (iii) visible frost damage after the frost on the night of May 3rd/4th (DOY 123/124), (iv) re-sprouting 19--38 days after the frost, and (v) full maturity around DOY 178 (166--184) when all beech crowns had fully recovered. Since frost damage was nearly 100{\%}, individual susceptibility did not depend on the timing of first spring leaf unfolding. However, we could identify significant patterns in fitness linked to an earlier start of leaf unfolding. Those individuals that had an earlier start of greening during the first flushing period had a shorter period of recovery and started the second greening earlier. Thus, phenological timing triggered the speed of recovery from such an extreme event. The maximum greenness achieved, however, did not vary with leaf unfolding dates. Two mountain ashes (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were not affected by the low temperatures of -5$\,^{\circ}$C. Time series analysis of webcam pictures can thus improve process-based knowledge and provide valuable insights into the link between phenological variation, late spring frost damage, and recovery within one stand.},

	Abstract = {The history of mountain research is most fascinating. Three names for 3 centuries may give an idea of the growing knowledge about the world's mountains: Horace Be ´ne ´dict de Saussure, who climbed and studied the Mont Blanc in 1787; Alexander von Humboldt, ever investigating the environment during his attempt to ascend the Chimborazo in 1802; and Carl Troll, who founded the International Geographical Union's Commission on High-altitude Geoecology in 1968. Awareness of the growing impact of human activities on the environment led to scientific and political initiatives at the global level, beginning in the 1970s. The Perth conference in 2010 has offered an opportunity to both look back on these developments and explore the future of the world's mountains in a time of rapidly growing ``global change'' problems and processes.

	Abstract = {Global warming is affecting natural systems across the world. Of the biological responses to warming, changes in the timing of phenological events such as flowering are among the most sensitive. Despite the recognized importance of phenological changes, the limited number of long-term records of phenological events has restricted research on the topic in most areas of the world. In a previous study in Boston (American Journal of Botany 91: 1260-1264), we used herbarium specimens and one season of field observations to show that plants flowered earlier as the climate warmed over the past 100 yr. In our new study, we found that two extra years of data did not strengthen the explanatory power of the analysis. Analysis of herbarium specimens without any field data yielded results similar to analyses that included field observations. In addition, we found that photographs of cultivated and wild plants in Massachusetts, data similar to that contained in herbarium specimens, show changes in flowering times that closely match independent data on the same species in the same locations. Dated photographs of plants in flower represent a new resource to extend the range of species and localities addressed in global-warming research.},

@article{Moorcroft2001,
	Abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size- and age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15$\,^{\circ}$ N to 15$\,^{\circ}$ S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.},

	Abstract = {Recent shifts in phenology are the best documented biological response to current anthropogenic climate change, yet remain poorly understood from a functional point of view. Prevailing analyses are phenomenological and approximate, only correlating temperature records to imprecise records of phenological events. To advance our understanding of phenological responses to climate change, we developed, calibrated, and validated process-based models of leaf unfolding for 22 North American tree species. Using daily meteorological data predicted by two scenarios (A2: +3.2 {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C and B2: +1 {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C) from the HadCM3 GCM, we predicted and compared range-wide shifts of leaf unfolding in the 20th and 21st centuries for each species. Model predictions suggest that climate change will affect leaf phenology in almost all species studied, with an average advancement during the 21st century of 5.0 days in the A2 scenario and 9.2 days in the B2 scenario. Our model also suggests that lack of sufficient chilling temperatures to break bud dormancy will decrease the rate of advancement in leaf unfolding date during the 21st century for many species. Some temperate species may even have years with abnormal budburst due to insufficient chilling. Species fell into two groups based on their sensitivity to climate change: (1) species that consistently had a greater advance in their leaf unfolding date with increasing latitude and (2) species in which the advance in leaf unfolding differed from the center to the northern vs. southern margins of their range. At the interspecific level, we predicted that early-leafing species tended to show a greater advance in leaf unfolding date than late-leafing species; and that species with larger ranges tend to show stronger phenological changes. These predicted changes in phenology have significant implications for the frost susceptibility of species, their interspecific relationships, and their distributional shifts.},

	Abstract = {From both social and environmental perspectives, water is the main connection between highland and lowland processes in mountain watersheds: Water flows downhill while human impacts flow uphill. For example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers, surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier, resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests. Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused. Such an approach should include not only established watershed classification parameters such as topology and geology but also interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances. To understand the combined impacts of climate change and humans on water in mountain watersheds, researchers must develop integrated monitoring and modeling systems that explicitly include connections across eco-hydrologic and social-ecological systems.},

	Abstract = {Detailed homogeneity assessments of daily weather observing station data from Canada, the United States, and Mexico enabled analysis of changes in North American extremes starting in 1950. The approach used a number of indices derived from the daily data, primarily based on the number of days per year that temperature or precipitation observations were above or below percentile thresholds. Station level indices were gridded to produce North American area-averaged time series. The results indicated that the increase in the number of days exceeding the 90th percentile is about the same magnitude as the decrease in the number of days below the 10th percentile. Analysis of extremes farther out on the tails of the distribution (e.g., 95th and 97.5th percentiles) reveals changes very similar to the 90th and 10th percentiles. Annual extreme lowest temperatures are warming faster than annual extreme highest temperatures when the index assessed is the actual temperature, but cold and hot extremes are changing about the same when examined on a normalized basis. On the basis of several measures, heavy precipitation has been increasing over the last half century, and the average amount of precipitation falling on days with precipitation has also been increasing. These observed changes since the late 1960s, decrease in cold extremes, increases in warm extremes, and increases in heavy precipitation, are consistent with a warming planet},

	Abstract = {Climate warming fosters an earlier spring green-up that may bring potential benefits to agricultural systems. However, advances in green-up timing may leave early stage vegetation growth vulnerable to cold damage when hard freezes follow green-up resulting in a false spring. Spatiotemporal patterns of green-up dates, last spring freezes, and false springs were examined across the contiguous United States from 1920 to 2013. Results indicate widespread earlier green-up and last spring freeze dates over the period. Observed changes in these dates were asymmetric with the last spring freeze date advancing to earlier in the year relative to green-up date. Although regionally variable, these changes resulted in a reduction in false springs, notably over the past 20 years, except across the intermountain western United States where the advance in green-up timing outpaced that of the last spring freeze. A sensitivity experiment shows that observed decreases in false springs are consistent with a warming climate.},

	Abstract = {Leafing-out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf-out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf-out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf-out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf-out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf-out will affect carbon sequestration, plant-animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf-out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf-out timing. For most species, onset of leaf-out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset.},

	Abstract = {To elucidate climate-driven changes in leaf-out phenology and their implications for species invasions, we observed and experimentally manipulated leaf out of invasive and native woody plants in Concord, MA, USA. Using observations collected by Henry David Thoreau (1852-1860) and our own observations (2009-2013), we analyzed changes in leaf-out timing and sensitivity to temperature for 43 woody plant species. We experimentally tested winter chilling requirements of 50 species by exposing cut branches to warm indoor temperatures (22{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C) during the winter and spring of 2013. Woody species are now leafing out an average of 18 d earlier than they did in the 1850s, and are advancing at a rate of 5 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 1 d {\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C(-1) . Functional groups differ significantly in the duration of chilling they require to leaf out: invasive shrubs generally have weaker chilling requirements than native shrubs and leaf out faster in the laboratory and earlier in the field; native trees have the strongest chilling requirements. Our results suggest that invasive shrub species will continue to have a competitive advantage as the climate warms, because native plants are slower to respond to warming spring temperatures and, in the future, may not meet their chilling requirements.},

	Abstract = {Ungulate communities are changing at a global scale, which is increasing the need for landscape scale quantification of ungulate impacts on plant communities. To achieve robust monitoring across variable landscapes, managers need quick and reliable indicators for assessing ungulate impacts. Our goal was to evaluate two direct (meristem removal, defoliation) and two indirect methods (fecal counts, camera counts) for evaluating ungulate activity on forest regeneration after fire. We examined the relationships between measures of browse activity (meristem removal, defoliation) of aspen with ungulate community estimates (fecal and camera counts) as a function of variation in physiographic conditions across the study sites. Measurements were made in belt transects at 28 sites across three fires that burned in National Forests in Utah in 2012. Aspen height was best predicted by a model with meristem removal, terrain ruggedness, aspect, and year. Mean aspen height was 5 cm lower for every 10% increase in meristem removal an effect that increased over time. We found moderate correlation between the year and percent defoliation interaction and aspen density. Percent defoliation was related to reduced aspen density in the 2nd and 3rd years but not in the 1st year. Results demonstrated that meristem removal is correlated closely with ocular estimates of defoliation (r2 = 0.83), ungulate abundance using fecal counts (r2 = 0.65) and camera counts (r2 = 0.63). Fecal counts and camera counts also correlated well with each other (r2 = 0.74). Estimates of meristem removal in our study suggest that 75% browse of apical meristems is an important threshold for successful aspen height growth and 50% defoliation for aspen regeneration density. Our study highlights the strengths of measurements of meristem removal and defoliation to predict ungulate effects on forest recruitment potential.},

	Abstract = {Freeze injury is one of the main limiting factors to crop production and distribution of horticultural crops. Despite the numerous research efforts devoted to reduce freezing injury, it still accounts for greater losses of fruits and vegetables than any other environmental or biological hazard and the ultimate causes determining cold hardiness remain uncertain. In temperate climates, important damages on deciduous fruit trees are produced in buds, flowers and developing fruits after dormancy and losses due to frosts during bloom are usually more important than those due to low winter temperatures. The information available on the influence of late spring frosts on reproductive organs of deciduous fruit trees in temperate climates is reviewed. The freezing process is examined, paying attention to how subsequent frost damage is caused at the cellular level as well as its anatomical and morphological consequences in flowers and fruits. The flower hardiness response is evaluated in terms of genotype, phenology and a number of physiological aspects as the formation of ice nucleation, moisture content and nutritive status. Finally, new perspectives are explored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Savolainen2007,
	Abstract = { Populations are locally adapted when populations have the highest relative fitness at their home sites, and lower fitness in other parts of the range. Results from the extensive experimental plantations of populations of forest trees from different parts of the range show that populations can survive and grow in broad areas outside the home site. However, intra- and interspecific competition limit the distribution of genotypes. For populations from large parts of the range, relative fitness, compared with the local population, is often highest at the home site. At the edges of the range, this local adaptation may break down. The extent of local adaptation is determined by the balance between gene flow and selection. Genetic differentiation and strong natural selection occur over a range of tens or hundreds of kilometers, but reliable measurements of gene flow are available only for much shorter distances. Current models of spatially varying selection could be made more realistic by the incorporation of strong selection and isolation-by-distance characteristic of tree populations. Many studies suggest that most variation in adaptive traits is based on loci with small effects. Association genetics methods and improved genomic resources are useful for the identification of the loci responsible for this variation. The potential for adaptation to current climate change depends on genetic variation and dispersal and establishment rates. },

	Abstract = {The onset of the spring season is a phenomenon associated with systematic changes in the land surface-atmosphere interface, which will likely be modified by climate change. A measure of this complex feature, or 'spring index', should reflect the variations in both weather events and plant physiology usually identified with mid-latitutde spring. In this study, variables representing plant phenology, synoptic weather system frequency, surface temperature-thickness relationship 'breaks' (difference between surface maximum temperature and thickness-derived layer mean temperature), and last freeze date (0.degree. C or lower) are compared and examined as components of a comprehensive measure of the onset of spring. Two small networks of stations in the eastern and central United States are used as test data over the period 1961 to 1980. The phenology-synoptic weather component (P-SW), derived from regression-based models of first leaf emergence, has the strongest relationship with other measures, and can be produced from generally available surface data. This component is proposed as a first approximation of a comprehensive spring index, suitable for analyzing the impact of past and future climate changes on the onset of spring.},

	Abstract = {Onset of the growing season in mid-latitudes is a period of rapid transition, which includes heightened interaction between living organisms and the lower atmosphere. Phenological events (seasonal plant and animal activity driven by environmental factors), such as first leaf appearance or flower bloom in plants, can serve as convenient markers to monitor the progression of this yearly shift, and assess longer-term change resulting from climate variations. We examined spring seasons across North America over the 1900-1997 period using modelled and actual lilac phenological data. Regional differences were detected, as well as an average 5-6 day advance toward earlier springs, over a 35-year period from 1959-1993. Driven by seasonally warmer temperatures, this modification agrees with earlier bird nesting times, and corresponds to a comparable advance of spring plant phenology described in Europe. These results also align with trends towards longer growing seasons, reported by recent carbon dioxide and satellite studies. North American spring warming is strongest regionally in the northwest and northeast portions. Meanwhile, slight autumn cooling is apparent in the central USA.

	Abstract = {National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-series satellites, carrying advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensors, have allowed moderate resolution (1 km) measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to be collected from the Earth's land surfaces for over 20 years. Across the conterminous USA, a readily accessible and decade-long data set is now available to study many aspects of vegetation activity in this region. One feature, the onset of deciduous plant growth at the start of the spring season (SOS) is of special interest, as it appears to be crucial for accurate computation of several important biospheric processes, and a sensitive measure of the impacts of global change.In this study, satellite-derived SOS dates produced by the delayed moving average (DMA) and seasonal midpoint NDVI (SMN) methods, and modelled surface phenology (spring indices, SI) were compared at widespread deciduous forest and mixed woodland sites during 1990-93 and 1995-99, and these three measures were also matched to native species bud-break data collected at the Harvard Forest (Massachusetts) over the same time period. The results show that both SOS methods are doing a modestly accurate job of tracking the general pattern of surface phenology, but highlight the temporal limitations of biweekly satellite data. Specifically, at deciduous forest sites: (1) SMN SOS dates are close in time to SI first bloom dates (average bias of +0.74 days), whereas DMA SOS dates are considerably earlier (average bias of -41.24 days) and also systematically earlier in late spring than in early spring; (2) SMN SOS tracks overall yearly trends in deciduous forests somewhat better than DMA SOS, but with larger average error (MAEs 8.64 days and 7.37 days respectively); and (3) error in both SOS techniques varies considerably by year.

	Abstract = {Recent warming of Northern Hemisphere (NH) land is well documented and typically greater in winter/spring than other seasons. Physical environment responses to warming have been reported, but not details of large-area temperate growing season impacts, or consequences for ecosystems and agriculture. To date, hemispheric-scale measurements of biospheric changes have been confined to remote sensing. However, these studies did not provide detailed data needed for many investigations. Here, we show that a suite of modeled and derived measures (produced from daily maximum--minimum temperatures) linking plant development (phenology) with its basic climatic drivers provide a reliable and spatially extensive method for monitoring general impacts of global warming on the start of the growing season. Results are consistent with prior smaller area studies, confirming a nearly universal quicker onset of early spring warmth (spring indices (SI) first leaf date, −1.2 days decade−1), late spring warmth (SI first bloom date, −1.0 days decade−1; last spring day below 5{\$}\backslash,{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}C, −1.4 days decade−1), and last spring freeze date (−1.5 days decade−1) across most temperate NH land regions over the 1955--2002 period.However, dynamics differ among major continental areas with North American first leaf and last freeze date changes displaying a complex spatial relationship. Europe presents a spatial pattern of change, with western continental areas showing last freeze dates getting earlier faster, some central areas having last freeze and first leaf dates progressing at about the same pace, while in portions of Northern and Eastern Europe first leaf dates are getting earlier faster than last freeze dates. Across East Asia last freeze dates are getting earlier faster than first leaf dates.},

	Abstract = {Measuring the onset of deciduous tree leaf flush and subsequent development during the spring season in temperate climates can be accomplished using multiple ground and satellite-based techniques. Although all these measurements are valid (i.e. record a real characteristic related to plant development), they typically are poorly inter- related due to incompatible levels of spatial representation and differing methodologies. Given recent and likely future impacts of climate change on spring leaf development, the need to reconstruct past patterns, and the lack of standardised vegetation change measurements around the world, more work is needed to determine the relationships among the various measures, and the degree to which they may serve as substitutes for each other. In this article, we use observations and measurements at two phenology `super-sites' in eastern North America and four other supporting sites to evaluate the relationships among multiple spring leaf development measures, and explore strategies to standardise their intercomparison. The results show infrequent significant correlations among 10 satellite-derived `start of season' (SOS) measures (which suggests they are often not detecting the same phenomena), along with more common significant correlations among six ground phenology measures. However, when ground phenology and satellite-derived SOS are compared, there are few significant correlations, even at sites with extensive native species phenology available. Modelled phenology, based on daily temperature data (Spring Indices First Bloom date) does as well as any of the direct native species measures, and is well suited to facilitate intercomparisons. In order to effectively compare ground-based and satellite-derived SOS measures, approaches that use limited numbers of individual plants face considerable challenges. Given that satellite-derived measures are areal and at a scale of 250 m and larger, we suggest collecting ground phenology data at the same areal scale in order to make effective comparisons.},

@article{St.Clair2009,
	Abstract = {In May 2007, a widespread frost event defoliated much of Utah's high elevation aspen. About 5 weeks later, the frost-defoliated aspen produced a second leaf flush. The objective of this study was to characterize changes in leaf morphology and function in re-flush leaves following frost defoliation. Leaf size and thickness, photosynthesis, carbohydrate and nutrient status, and defense chemistry (phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins) were measured in first and second flush leaves. The second flush leaves produced two different morphological responses depending on frost damage severity. Severe frost damage was characterized by patchy canopy re-flushing with leaves that were on average four times larger than the first flush leaves. Moderate frost damage produced full canopy flushes with second flush leaves that were typically smaller than the first flush leaves. The second flush leaves tended to be thicker, and had significantly lower nutrient and sucrose concentrations, but had equal or higher rates of photosynthesis. These leaves showed a general pattern of defense chemistry induction with phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins increasing two- to threefold. Some of the changes in leaf morphology and defense chemistry observed in second flush leaves in 2007 persisted in leaves produced in the following year. We hypothesize that defense chemistry induction following abiotic defoliation serves as insurance against secondary defoliation events by herbivores that may further deplete nutrient and carbohydrate leaf resources below threshold points that are critical for physiological function. Resource dilution and allocation to secondary defense may place constraints on growth capacity.},

@article{Taylor2019,
	Abstract = {Abstract Large-scale observational data from citizen science efforts are becoming increasingly common in ecology, and researchers often choose between these and data from intensive local-scale studies for their analyses. This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and interannual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built statistical and process based phenology models for species common to each data set. From these models, we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both USA-NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two data sets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for USA-NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the USA-NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. This difference in the cross-scale model comparison is likely due to variation in phenological requirements within species. Models using the USA-NPN data set can integrate parameters over a large spatial scale while those using an LTER data set can only estimate parameters for a single location. Accordingly, the choice of data set depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if USA-NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale USA-NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER data sets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models that integrate the strengths of both data sets.},

	Abstract = {Biome-BGC is a computer program that estimates fluxes and storage of energy, water, carbon, and nitrogen for the vegetation and soil components of terrestrial ecosystems. The primary model purpose is to study global and regional interactions between climate, disturbance, and biogeochemical cycles.Biome-BGC represents physical and biological processes that control fluxes of energy and mass. These processes include: New leaf growth and old leaf litterfall Sunlight interception by leaves and penetration to the ground Precipitation routing to leaves and soil Snow accumulation and melting Drainage and runoff of soil water Evaporation of water from soil and wet leaves Transpiration of soil water through leaf stomata Photosynthetic fixation of carbon from CO2 in the air Uptake of nitrogen from the soil Distribution of carbon and nitrogen to growing plant parts Decomposition of fresh plant litter and old soil organic matter Plant mortality Fire The model uses a daily time-step. This means that each flux is estimated for a one-day period. Between days, the program updates its memory of the mass stored in different components of the vegetation, litter, and soil. Weather is the most important control on vegetation processes. Flux estimates in Biome-BGC depend strongly on daily weather conditions. Model behavior over time depends on climate--the history of these weather conditions.A companion file with more information about Biome-BGC and its components is available at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/model{\_}archive/BIOME{\_}BGC/biome{\_}bgc{\_}4.1.1/comp/BiomeBGC{\_}v411{\_}release.pdf .Biome-BGC, Version 4.1.1 was developed and is maintained by the  Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group, School of Forestry, The University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, USA.

	Abstract = {Climate model output is used to analyze the behavior of extreme cold-air outbreaks (CAOs) under recent and future climatic conditions. The study uses daily output from seven GCMs run under late-twentieth century and projected twenty-first century radiative conditions (SRES A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario). We define a CAO as an occurrence of two or more consecutive days during which the local mean daily surface air temperature is at least two standard deviations below the local wintertime mean temperature. In agreement with observations, the models generally simulate modern CAOs most frequently over western North America and Europe and least commonly over the Arctic. These favored regions for CAOs are located downstream from preferred locations of atmospheric blocking. Future projections indicate that CAOs---defined with respect to late-twentieth century climatic conditions---will decline in frequency by 50 to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} in most of the Northern Hemisphere during the twenty-first century. Certain regions, however, show relatively small changes and others actually experience more CAOs in the future, due to atmospheric circulation changes and internal variability that counter the thermodynamic tendency from greenhouse forcing. These areas generally experience greater near-surface wind flow from the north or the continent during the twenty-first century and/or are especially prone to atmospheric blocking events. Simulated reductions in CAOs are smallest in western North America, the North Atlantic, and in southern regions of Europe and Asia. The Eurasian pattern is driven by a strong tendency for the models to produce sea-level pressure (SLP) increases in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea (intermodel mean of 3 hPa), causing greater advection of continental air from northern and central Asia, while the muted change over western North America is due to enhanced ridging along the west coast and the increased frequency of blocking events. The North Atlantic response is consistent with a slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, which either damps the warming regionally or results in a cooler mean climate in the vicinity of Greenland.

	Abstract = {Phenological events, such as the initiation and the end of seasonal growth, are thought to be under strong evolutionary control because of their influence on tree fitness. Although numerous studies highlighted genetic differentiation in phenology among populations from contrasting climates, it remains unclear whether local adaptation could restrict phenological plasticity in response to current warming. Seedling populations of seven deciduous tree species from high and low elevations in the Swiss Alps were investigated in eight common gardens located along two elevational gradients from 400 to 1,700 m. We addressed the following questions: are there genetic differentiations in phenology between populations from low and high elevations, and are populations from the upper elevational limit of a species' distribution able to respond to increasing temperature to the same extent as low-elevation populations? Genetic variation of leaf unfolding date between seedlings from low and high populations was detected in six out of seven tree species. Except for beech, populations from high elevations tended to flush later than populations from low elevations, emphasizing that phenology is likely to be under evolutionary pressure. Furthermore, seedlings from high elevation exhibited lower phenological plasticity to temperature than low-elevation provenances. This difference in phenological plasticity may reflect the opposing selective forces involved (i.e. a trade-off between maximizing growing season length and avoiding frost damages). Nevertheless, environmental effects were much stronger than genetic effects, suggesting a high phenological plasticity to enable tree populations to track ongoing climate change, which includes the risk of tracking unusually warm springs followed by frost.},

Our study highlights that the timing of spring phenology has evolved in such a way that it minimizes the risk of freeze damage according to the species-specific LT50. Early flushing species are among the most freezing-resistant species during flushing, whereas late flushing species are among the least resistant. We conclude that for the examined species the species-specific freezing resistance during leaf emergence could be extracted from either adult or juvenile trees, as long as it is estimated at a same phenological stage},

	Abstract = {Temperate climates are defined by distinct temperature seasonality with large and often unpredictable weather during any of the four seasons. To thrive in such climates, trees have to withstand a cold winter and the stochastic occurrence of freeze events during any time of the year. The physiological mechanisms trees adopt to escape, avoid, and tolerate freezing temperatures include a cold acclimation in autumn, a dormancy period during winter (leafless in deciduous trees), and the maintenance of a certain freezing tolerance during dehardening in early spring. The change from one phase to the next is mediated by complex interactions between temperature and photoperiod. This review aims at providing an overview of the interplay between phenology of leaves and species-specific freezing resistance. First, we address the long-term evolutionary responses that enabled temperate trees to tolerate certain low temperature extremes. We provide evidence that short term acclimation of freezing resistance plays a crucial role both in dormant and active buds, including re-acclimation to cold conditions following warm spells. This ability declines to almost zero during leaf emergence. Second, we show that the risk that native temperate trees encounter freeze injuries is low and is confined to spring and underline that this risk might be altered by climate warming depending on species-specific phenological responses to environmental cues.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Increasing temperatures should facilitate the poleward movement of species distributions through a variety of processes, including increasing the growing season length. However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

@article{Williamson2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract Arctic warming is resulting in reduced snow cover and increased shrub growth, both of which have been associated with altered land surface--atmospheric feedback processes involving sensible heat flux, ground heat flux and biogeochemical cycling. Using field measurements, we show that two common Arctic shrub species (Betula glandulosa and Salix pulchra), which are largely responsible for shrub encroachment in tundra, differed markedly in albedo and that albedo of both species increased as growing season progressed when measured at their altitudinal limit. A moveable apparatus was used to repeatedly measure albedo at six precise spots during the summer of 2012, and resampled in 2013. Contrary to the generally accepted view of shrub-covered areas having low albedo in tundra, full-canopy prostrate B. glandulosa had almost the highest albedo of all surfaces measured during the peak of the growing season. The higher midsummer albedo is also evident in localized MODIS albedo aggregated from 2000 to 2013, which displays a similar increase in growing-season albedo. Using our field measurements, we show the ensemble summer increase in tundra albedo counteracts the generalized effect of earlier spring snow melt on surface energy balance by approximately 40\%. This summer increase in albedo, when viewed in absolute values, is as large as the difference between the forest and tundra transition. These results indicate that near future (<50 years) changes in growing-season albedo related to Arctic vegetation change are unlikely to be particularly large and might constitute a negative feedback to climate warming in certain circumstances. Future efforts to calculate energy budgets and a sensible heating feedback in the Arctic will require more detailed information about the relative abundance of different ground cover types, particularly shrub species and their respective growth forms and phenology.},

	Abstract = {Climate change has led to major changes in the phenology (the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering) of some species but not others. The extent to which flowering-time response to temperature is shared among closely related species might have important consequences for community-wide patterns of species loss under rapid climate change. Henry David Thoreau initiated a dataset of the Concord, Massachusetts, flora that spans approximately 150 years and provides information on changes in species abundance and flowering time. When these data are analyzed in a phylogenetic context, they indicate that change in abundance is strongly correlated with flowering-time response. Species that do not respond to temperature have decreased greatly in abundance, and include among others anemones and buttercups [Ranunculaceae pro parte (p.p.)], asters and campanulas (Asterales), bluets (Rubiaceae p.p.), bladderworts (Lentibulariaceae), dogwoods (Cornaceae), lilies (Liliales), mints (Lamiaceae p.p.), orchids (Orchidaceae), roses (Rosaceae p.p.), saxifrages (Saxifragales), and violets (Malpighiales). Because flowering-time response traits are shared among closely related species, our findings suggest that climate change has affected and will likely continue to shape the phylogenetically biased pattern of species loss in Thoreau's woods.},

	Abstract = {Warming experiments are increasingly relied on to estimate plant responses to global climate change. For experiments to provide meaningful predictions of future responses, they should reflect the empirical record of responses to temperature variability and recent warming, including advances in the timing of flowering and leafing. We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1,634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, compared with long-term observations. For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.},

	Abstract = {Two fundamental axes -- space and time -- shape ecological systems. Over the last 30 years spatial ecology has developed as an integrative, multidisciplinary science that has improved our under-standing of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation and loss. We argue that acceler-ating climate change -- the effective manipulation of time by humans -- has generated a current need to build an equivalent framework for temporal ecology. Climate change has at once pressed ecologists to understand and predict ecological dynamics in non-stationary environments, while also challenged fundamental assumptions of many concepts, models and approaches. However, similarities between space and time, especially related issues of scaling, provide an outline for improving ecological models and forecasting of temporal dynamics, while the unique attributes of time, particularly its emphasis on events and its singular direction, highlight where new approaches are needed. We emphasise how a renewed, interdisciplinary focus on time would coa-lesce related concepts, help develop new theories and methods and guide further data collection. The next challenge will be to unite predictive frameworks from spatial and temporal ecology to build robust forecasts of when and where environmental change will pose the largest threats to species and ecosystems, as well as identifying the best opportunities for conservation.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, research in invasion biology has focused increasing attention on understanding the role of phenology in shaping plant invasions. Multiple studies have found non-native species that tend to flower distinctly early or late in the growing season, advance more with warming or have shifted earlier with climate change compared with native species. This growing body of literature has focused on patterns of phenological differences, but there is a need now for mechanistic studies of how phenology contributes to invasions. To do this, however, requires understanding how phenology fits within complex functional trait relationships. Towards this goal, we review recent literature linking phenology with other functional traits, and discuss the role of phenology in mediating how plants experience disturbance and stress-via climate, herbivory and competition-across the growing season. Because climate change may alter the timing and severity of stress and disturbance in many systems, it could provide novel opportunities for invasion-depending upon the dominant climate controller of the system, the projected climate change, and the traits of native and non-native species. Based on our current understanding of plant phenological and growth strategies-especially rapid growing, early-flowering species versus later-flowering species that make slower-return investments in growth-we project optimal periods for invasions across three distinct systems under current climate change scenarios. Research on plant invasions and phenology within this predictive framework would provide a more rigorous test of what drives invader success, while at the same time testing basic plant ecological theory. Additionally, extensions could provide the basis to model how ecosystem processes may shift in the future with continued climate change.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in food web ecology highlight that most real food webs (1) represent an interplay between producer and detritus-based webs and, (2) are governed by consumers which are rampant omnivores-feeding on varied prey across trophic levels and resource channels. A possible avenue to unify these advances comes from models demonstrating that predators feeding on distinctly different channels may stabilize food webs. Empirical studies suggest many consumers engage in such behavior by feeding on prey items from both living-autotroph (green) and detritus-based (brown) webs-what we term 'multi-channel feeding'-yet we know little about how common such feeding is across systems and trophic levels, or its effect on system stability. Considering 23 empirical webs, we find that multi-channel feeding is equally common across terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems, with {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}50{\{}{\%}{\}} of consumers classified as multi-channel consumers. Multi-channel feeding occurred most often at the first consumer level, indicating ...},

	Abstract = {The Greater Himalayas hold the largest mass of ice outside polar regions and are the source of the 10 largest rivers in Asia. Rapid reduction in the volume of Himalayan glaciers due to climate change is occurring. The cascading effects of rising temperatures and loss of ice and snow in the region are affecting, for example, water availability (amounts, seasonality), biodiversity (endemic species, predator-prey relations), ecosystem boundary shifts (tree-line movements, high-elevation ecosystem changes), and global feedbacks (monsoonal shifts, loss of soil carbon). Climate change will also have environmental and social impacts that will likely increase uncertainty in water supplies and agricultural production for human populations across Asia. A common understanding of climate change needs to be developed through regional and local-scale research so that mitigation and adaptation strategies can be identified and implemented. The challenges brought about by climate change in the Greater Himalayas can only be addressed through increased regional collaboration in scientific research and policy making.},

	Abstract = {Climate change has caused advances in spring phases of many plant species. Theoretically, however, strong warming in winter could slow the fulfillment of chilling requirements, which may delay spring phenology. This phenomenon should be particularly pronounced in regions that are experiencing rapid temperature increases and are characterized by highly temperature-responsive vegetation. To test this hypothesis, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ratio method to determine the beginning, end, and length of the growing season of meadow and steppe vegetation of the Tibetan Plateau in Western China between 1982 and 2006. We then correlated observed phenological dates with monthly temperatures for the entire period on record. For both vegetation types, spring phenology initially advanced, but started retreating in the mid-1990s in spite of continued warming. Together with an advancing end of the growing season for steppe vegetation, this led to a shortening of the growing period. Partial least-squares regression indicated that temperatures in both winter and spring had strong effects on spring phenology. Although warm springs led to an advance of the growing season, warm conditions in winter caused a delay of the spring phases. This delay appeared to be related to later fulfillment of chilling requirements. Because most plants from temperate and cold climates experience a period of dormancy in winter, it seems likely that similar effects occur in other environments. Continued warming may strengthen this effect and attenuate or even reverse the advancing trend in spring phenology that has dominated climate-change responses of plants thus far.},

	Abstract = {Frost in late spring causes severe ecosystem damage in temperate and boreal regions. We here analyze late-spring frost occurrences between 1959 and 2017 and woody species{\textquoteright} resistance strategies to forecast forest vulnerability under climate change. Leaf-out phenology and leaf-freezing resistance data come from up to 1,500 species cultivated in common gardens. The greatest increase in leaf-damaging spring frost has occurred in Europe and East Asia, where species are more vulnerable to spring frost than in North America. The data imply that 35 and 26\% of Europe{\textquoteright}s and Asia{\textquoteright}s forests are increasingly threatened by frost damage, while this is only true for 10\% of North America. Phenological strategies that helped trees tolerate past frost frequencies will thus be increasingly mismatched to future conditionsLate-spring frosts (LSFs) affect the performance of plants and animals across the world{\textquoteright}s temperate and boreal zones, but despite their ecological and economic impact on agriculture and forestry, the geographic distribution and evolutionary impact of these frost events are poorly understood. Here, we analyze LSFs between 1959 and 2017 and the resistance strategies of Northern Hemisphere woody species to infer trees{\textquoteright} adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves and to forecast forest vulnerability under the ongoing changes in frost frequencies. Trait values on leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance come from up to 1,500 temperate and boreal woody species cultivated in common gardens. We find that areas in which LSFs are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which LSFs used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). LSFs in the latter regions are currently increasing, and given species{\textquoteright} innate resistance strategies, we estimate that \~{}35\% of the European and \~{}26\% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only \~{}10\% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.},
